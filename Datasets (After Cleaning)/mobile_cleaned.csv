I took a look and the problem in glossary is that we first fetch the entry, and then we fetch the glossary. This means we don't have the contextInstanceId (glossary.coursemodule) when the entry is rendered, so filters aren't applied.

The format-text directive should re-format the contents if the _contextLevel_ or the _contextInstanceId_ have changed. Also, templates might want to use an ngIf to prevent the contents to render before all the data is ready (for performance reasons).

Is the displaying of database activity supported in a mobile environment (iOS) ?

It seems that I'm the first to suggest this improvement, but we have some troubles with the database presentation when displayed on an Ipad. For example, when there is a file to upload, the screen is overwhelmed by many (most of them not useful) information such as ALL the formats allowed, the maximum number of file, the maximum size allowed , etc ... and, therefore, it becomes difficult to see where to put your finger in order to upload the file...

 

Is there a possibility to have a presentation close to that obtained with a web browser ? (which is, in this case mobile friendly) ?

Thanks for your answer

so the value of iconurl is: ...*auth_shibboleth/logo{color:#de350b}//{color}seka_logo_lock.png*

 My guess is the moodle system (probably auth_shibboleth) constructs the logo URL with an error (double slashes between the file path and the file name). This is a fairly common error and in most cases it is silently ignored. Actually this URL works if used in a browser. But the Moodle app thinks it is a bad URL, and prevents everyone from logging in.

In my opinion the bug is not is the Moodle app, but in the auth_shibboleth module, but the error affects mobile users very seriously, so I am reporting it here. I think even if the error is fixed in auth_shibboleth, it is a good idea to review the URL checking code in Moodle app, and relax it a bit, so this kind of error never occurs.

quen,2019-10-11T13:23:53.000+0000,quen,"When you view or download an activity, this results in two types of data being stored in the device:

* Files (these are stored in the filepool_files/filepool_files_links SQLite tables)
* Web service responses (these are stored in the wscache SQLite tables)

The 'Manage storage' screen and associated infrastructure for deleting downloaded content only includes files.

So for example if you view a Forum and some posts and this contains 10 KB of messages, mainly HTML code (retrieved using a web service), and also has a 10 KB image file in one of the posts, this will show as 10 KB in the manage storage screen.

Also if you view a Forum which contains 50 KB of HTML code and no images, even though this is actually bigger, it will not show up at all in the manage storage screen.

It is even more confusing if you click the download cloud icon next to the Forum with no images. In this case, you will see a progress bar, and the cloud icon will change to the 'Downloaded' icon. So you will reasonably assume that it should now show up on the manage storage screen, but it still doesn't. 

The key points of confusion are:

* If this doesn't take up any storage space, does this mean I can't use it offline?
* I can use this offline - it must be stored somewhere - how come I can't delete it?

I propose we extend the current APIs so that some web service requests can be marked as 'belonging to' a particular activity, and can be counted in with the total size and also deleted if you delete data for that activity. This will not be a perfect solution as there are obviously going to be web service requests that do not relate to a single activity (for example, maybe some requests get data for everything in the course rather than the single activity) and these would still not be counted, but I hope we can at least make it behave a bit more like users would expect.

h3. Limitations
These limitations relate to existing code (also see MOBILE-3134):

1 For the context menu within an activity, the download size (including the new cache size) is computed when you go into an activity page and is not recomputed if you go into and out of a child page. 

For example, if you go into a forum, then open the menu, it might show 2 KB (size of discussion list). If you then go into a discussion, and back out into the forum main page, it will still show 2KB even though you have also loaded the discussion now. However, if you go all the way back to the course page, then re-enter the forum, it will update (e.g. to 3KB or whatever).

It already did this only with images and even worse (see next point) so I don't think it necessarily needs fixing as part of this change.

2 For downloaded files, sometimes if you download a file the size does not update until you refresh the activity/course.

This can be seen using the test script here and is true with the existing app, so I don't think it needs fixing as part of this improvement. The same problem doesn't apply to the newly-added cache size (I didn't make it cache that number).",Improvement,Minor,quen,,4,Reopened,To Do,Cached web service responses for activity should show in manage storage,2020-03-09T13:03:26.000+0000,MOBILE-3188,,MOBILE,

jleyva,2019-09-16T02:29:56.000+0000,zyten,"Hi, I am using Elementary OS Juno which is based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. I downloaded the Moodle Desktop AppImage (3.7.0.472) from [https://download.moodle.org/desktop|https://download.moodle.org/desktop/]. But when I open it, I can only 'see' a transparent window. I can see it in the dock, I can Alt+Tab to it and it gets focus when I do that (I can see it if I use my screenshot tool to capture active window). However the window remains transparent.

*System specification*

Elementary OS Juno x64
 elementary GTK+ theme (default)
 [AppImageLauncher |[https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher]]

*Steps to reproduce*
 # Double-click the AppImage
 # Run Once / Integrate and Run 

*Logs*

These are the output when I run the AppImage via terminal:
{code:java}

(AppImageLauncher:29344): Gtk-CRITICAL **: 09:18:47.363: Unable to load resource for composite template for type 'GtkDialog': The resource at “/org/gtk/libgtk/ui/gtkdialog.ui” failed to decompress

{code}
 

*Hotfixes that worked for me*
 # Switching GTK+ theme to anything else 

            - I can switch back to elementary without issues once the window appears.

            - It seems that switching theme redraws the window.

            - However on the Arc and Adwaita theme, the issue does occur at all. The window loads fine on first run. 

            - *The error messages are shown even for the Arc/Adwaita theme where the issue does not occur.*

        2. Un-maximizing the window (I have hot corners enabled. Thus, I could toggle maximise eventhough the window is invisible)

            - This seems to redraw the window as well.

 

*Troubleshooting*
 # Ran the Moodle Desktop AppImage using different GTK+ themes

            Works: Arc, Adwaita

            Does not work: Elementary, High Contrast

        2. Built the Moodle Desktop app from [source|[https://github.com/moodlehq/moodlemobile2]] as a Debian package as well as AppImage. Both of them failed to open (invisible) when using GTK+ themes from above.The hotfixes worked for both.

        3. Tested on a fresh user with and without AppImageLauncher installed. The issue remains the same. And the hotfixes work.

The issue seems to only affect certain GTK+ themes but since we cannot control what themes users will use, I suppose we should force a redraw through Electron?

 

*Resolution*

I sort of fixed it by commenting out line 57 in desktop/electron.js
{code:java}
mainWindow.maximize();{code}
I'm not sure if there would be any repercussions from doing that but I'd be happy to test any other possible fixes.

I have investigated and the cause is that our 'handlers' in mobile.php was:

            'linksview' => [
                'delegate' => 'CoreBlockDelegate',

                ]
            ]

Note that there is no 'displaydata' array. Adding this makes the block work again:

{code}
                'displaydata' => [
                ]
{code}

So this is easily fixed at our end. However, I think it would be better if the code continued to work if displaydata is omitted (it throws a javascript error). I'll submit a patch although this is not urgent.

tiennguyenphuc,2019-08-29T09:10:24.000+0000,jb23347,"The issue:
 For activity plugins image (and video) files included on a page using the core-external-content directive are being downloaded, stored and are viewable but the size menu item in the context menu (top right more icon) is not being displayed until the page is refreshed. For core activity plugins image files are always downloaded before the activity page displays (check the image url) and the size menu item displays the stored file size without the need for a refresh.

To replicate:
 * From an existing moodle plugin activity (e.g. ouwiki) add the three files that enable moodle app functionality (db/mobile.php, classes/mobile.php and templates/main_view.mustache - see attached sample files). Keep the app functionality to the minimum, but add an image (a core-external-content element) in the template with a dynamic src.
 * On the website, run notifications, add a course, add a student and enroll on course, enable mobile, add the activity and add one image for display to the activity. This image src should then be used as the fixed image url to be passed to the template in the app code above (ensuring the image will be served properly as a plugin file).
 * On the app sign in as student, navigate to the course, select the activity, check the image appears.
 * On the activity page in the app view the top right menu (three vertical dots), check the image size menu item does not appear (without a refresh: but do not refresh for the moment). Also check the src of the image on the page - it is still showing as an external file ([https://|https:]...), where after a refresh it is served locally (filesystem:....).

Comment:
 At this point the image is actually downloaded to the app and appears in the database (in filepool_files - view in chrome developer tools - Application > Storage > WebSQL). The file was downloaded by a call to addToQueueIfNeeded() (in filepoolProvider) that completed after the context menu items were refreshed. The activity is not downloaded completely so the download menu item displays (correct, because there could be other pages with files that may need downloading). Even though the file exists the size menu item does not appear. This is because the file queued for download completed after the context menu was last updated with an onContentLoaded() (core/siteplugins/components/module-index/module-index.ts) which would have refreshed the context menu.

So now if the user navigates back to the course, and then to the activity for a second time (alternatively just press the refresh menu icon), the menu now displays a downloaded file that could be deleted.

Our user testing indicates that it would be nice if the context menu would just update itself (like it does on a refresh) as it gives users more confidence over the size of local file storage on their devices. (Yes we have video and image heavy plugins, and users with concerns over storage capacity on their mobiles).

In the images attached we can see the core activity plugin shows the size menu item displayed. And the other image is what displays for a core activity plugin if the file is deleted. This is the same menu as for a plugin activity - the size menu item is missing - yet the file has been downloaded as is taking space in the database on the device.",Improvement,Minor,jb23347,,4,Reopened,To Do,For plugin activities the size context menu item is not updating automatically without a refresh,2020-02-19T07:24:02.000+0000,MOBILE-3134,,MOBILE,

To fix this, we propose something like the following:
 * tool_mobile_get_site_config should have the plugin version hash added to its return values.  This is stored by the app for later comparison.
 * When the app makes a web service call to check for messages, it should also call a new web service function which returns the current plugin version hash.
 * If the hash has changed from the initial value, the user is given a prompt that the app needs to reload.  Upon confirmation, the reload occurs (presumably something like window.navigator.reload() is sufficient, unless ionic has a tidier way of doing this).

we've encountered the following issue:

in Moodle 3.6 the usage of the dashboard blocks is checked to build the dashboard page in the app. If any of the blocks is not used in web, it won't be displayed in the app either. This affects the blocks: myoverview, timeline, recentlyaccessedcourses, recentlyaccesseditems and starredcourses.

If none of these blocks are placed in the web because instances could also use custom blocks and the site home alternative is not used, too, the app is simply not usable for the main feature (accessing courses).

In previous versions of Moodle it was not possible to detect which blocks were used on the site, so they were displayed all (myoverview and timeline).

Maybe it's worth thinking about displaying the other blocks, too. Either in general or maybe only if none of the new blocks is placed in the web. This would prevent cases where the app is simply not usable.

It would be good to add a QR code scanner and create QR code for any link via the app. Some initial ideas:
* Add a QR Code scanner in the More option of the app: if the text scanned is an URL that can be opened by the app, the app will redirect the user to the indicated page. If is not an URL, it would display the text with some convenience tools (like copy, share?)
* Add a QR Code scanner option in the RTE (rich text editor): So the scanned text can be inserted in the text
* Add a QR code scanner in the contextual/kebap menu? so the scanned text can be inserted in the text element focused? Like an input field for a short-answer, cloze...
* Add a QR code scanner option in the ""Add site"" page, so new sites can be added just scanning a code

 # We only load the site plugins of the current site, so if you receive a push for another site stored in the app, that push won't be handled by the site plugins because they aren't loaded. The only way I can think of to handle this is:
 ## If the click belongs to another site, logout the user and login in the other site.

 # If the push is clicked while the app is dead, it can take a while for site plugins to be loaded. We could be blocking the user for several seconds for nothing because maybe there is no site plugin to handle that link. I can't think of any way to solve this.

quen,2019-03-06T15:29:44.000+0000,quen,"This change creates a new page that allows the user to manage storage usage within a course. They can then delete activities (same as from the activity menu), or a whole section, or the whole course.

In all cases this works only for file storage and not anything else - it's just another interface to the existing facilities already available when you go inside an individual activity and use the 'delete' menu option. But obviously it's much easier if you can e.g. delete data for all the activities in a week once you finish studying that week, or all the activities in a course when you finish studying the course.

In our user testing of the Moodle app, storage on the device was one of the test users' major concerns - especially because of how it automatically downloads stuff as you view it. This gives users a nice at-a-glance way to manage storage within a course.

I'll attach screenshots to demonstrate that it looks pretty nice imo. :)

Some notes:

1. I implemented this as an addon because I thought it was a nice way to keep the code separate. That requires a new delegate for adding items to the course menu, which I've implemented and will file as a separate issue.

2. Regarding the user interface, I added an explanatory sentence to the screen. This is because in user testing, our users were worried that the delete icons would 'really' delete things from the course, rather than just free up space on their device.

3. I didn't put confirmation prompts on the delete buttons because, with the explanatory sentence, it seems pretty clear what they do, and I didn't want to scare users. Also, users may want to use this frequently (e.g. every week go and delete out last week) so it should be quick.

4. There is no connection between this and the existing option to wipe all storage for a whole site at once (from Settings). I don't think this is a critical problem however if we get a chance, we do plan to implement another page in between the two (that does a list of courses). That would obviously be another issue.

5. A known issue, which I should file as a separate tracker if I remember (and I'm not sure we currently intend to fix) is that if you view a page and it automatically downloads an image [as opposed to you actively downloading the activity], this doesn't seem to update the cached download size for the module, which means it won't show up on the new 'Manage storage' page unless you exit and restart the app. However, this is not part of the new UI and already applies to the existing code, because the dropdown menu in the activity that lets you delete the data & shows you the size, also doesn't update until you restart the app.

6. One thing that may confuse users is that (same as current interface) you cannot delete any of the web service results or other stuff that is downloaded that doesn't go into the filesystem. For example, if you click 'Download' next to an activity that doesn't contain any attached files, then it won't show up on this list. I don't have a solution for this yet, so far as I know we don't categorise these things in a way that they could be deleted at present.. Also they are likely to be rather small compared to video files so hopefully it's not too big a problem!

{quote}{{<core-rich-text-editor item-content placeholder=""<% placeholder %>""></core-rich-text-editor>}}
{quote}
The issue now is that there is an error in the console about not being able to get value from undefined in this.control.value on line 94 of rich-text-editor.ts. Because I have used my own methods to cope with data and changes in the rich text editor, other than these quite reasonable errors in the console, the editor works perfectly.

To remove these errors, so allow those like myself who would like to use the rich text editor in a plugin, I have created a simple patch. This is really just a hack that prevents the editor trying to use a FormControl where one does not exist, so is not a good long term solution, but would help in the short term.

dpalou,2019-01-30T09:09:33.000+0000,jleyva,"With the check updates WS, we now have a new problem regarding activities that can be prefetched and done in offline.

When the user generates some data in the app, the WS check_updates detects that there are some changes in the data (the one that was created by the app) so the activity is marked as outdated.

This is a major problem in scorm, lesson and quiz, since we require the user to have the data up to date before being able to continue the activity. This causes the following behaviour:
 # The user prefetches the activity.
 # The user opens the activity in online and generates some new data.
 # The user leaves the activity and goes offline.
 # The user tries to continue the activity in offline. He can't because the activity isn't up to date.

For lesson I thought we could be able to store the last time we prefetched the pages viewed/answered (not the whole module) and then compare that value with the result of check_updates, but the check_updates WS only returns the IDs of the items, not the date so it isn't possible.

The only option left is to re-download the whole module everytime the user leaves the activity, but that can increase the data usage a lot, specially if some file changes while the user was doing the activity. Maybe we should re-download only if the user is on wifi? Should we add a new setting?

 # In Moodle, create a database with a file field and a required text field.
 # In the app, go to the database and open the page to add a new entry.
 # Upload a file in the file field.
 # Leave the text field empty and try to save the entry.
 # The message ""You must supply a value here"" will be displayed next to the text field.
 # Enter some text in the text field and try to save the entry again.
 # Result: An error modal is displayed with message: ""NOT_FOUND_ERR"" and the entry is not saved.

This happens because the first time the entry is submitted files are uploaded to Moodle and deleted from the device.

This bug affects other pages in the app: it happens in the forum but it's more difficult to reproduce because the web service must return an error when sending a post.

 # First, upload files to Moodle to get a draft id but keep the temporary files in the device (but only if they are local files, if they are online files we can delete them because they will be downloaded again).

marxjohnson,2018-12-20T12:04:55.000+0000,marxjohnson,"When doing some testing of the Moodle app with our plugins installed, we found that there were occasions where opening a course using our course format plugin was displaying the course page using the default course format instead.  Tracking this down, it appears to be the case that if the web service request for the handler's init function is still in progress, the user can still open the course, but it wont use the correct format.  We've seen this frequently on our test environments, but also saw it on a live environment during a period of degraded server performance, so it's definitely a real-world scenario.

This is a big problem for us; since our custom format is signifiantly different from the core format, if users are able to view our courses using the default format it will be confusing and may expose content the users aren't meant to see.

Given that the app knows the course's format at this stage (from core_course_get_courses), and that there is a custom handler for this format (from tool_mobile_get_plugins_supporting_mobile), we would like to prevent the user being able to access the course until the format has been initialised.

Steps to reproduce:
# Install the attached format_topics2 course format plugin.  This has a very basic mobile delegate that displays ""This is a course in Topics 2 format!"" in place of the course page.  It also has an init function that is artifically delayed to simulate degraded performance.
# Create a course in topics2 format, and enrol a user
# Log in to the app as the user
# As soon as the course list is loaded, click on the course
# You will see the default course format

If you disable some of the items from the main menu in your Moodle site's Mobile Features settings (We have everything except for ""My websites"" and ""Web page"" disabled), and have a plugin which adds an item to the main menu, it will always display in the bottom bar.  Changing the priority of the handler will change the position of the icon, but only within the bottom bar - there is no way to make it display in the _More_ tab as described unless you already have 5 icons displayed in the bar.

This is problematic as the behaviour of your handler's page has subtle differences depending on whether its displayed in the bottom bar or the _More_ tab.  For example, the label is not displayed with the icon in the bottom bar, which you may want, and the ""Back"" behaviour is not the same in both cases.

From our point of view, this should either work as described in the documentation (never display custom items in the bottom bar), or there should be an option in the handler to display in the bottom bar if possible, or always display in the _More_ tab.

Our instructors like to keep courses open so students can go back and review resources and posts from previous courses as they move through their academic program, but they would also like to know which of those items are being accessed and it's confusing when they see that a student accessed the course (from the Participants screen) but don't see any activity logged.

Writing special code so that I could see the DOM source revealed that the problem appears to be caused because in working examples of videos, the video tag src attribute is of the form 'file://var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/...', whereas in non-working examples it is of the form 'cdvfile://localhost/persistent/sites/...'. 

Other resources such as image tags work fine with the 'cdvfile' syntax so presumably it is something especially weird with video files.

In a client's WBT videos are handled with MediaElement.js http://www.mediaelementjs.com/. In the videos captions are used. The caption files are loaded via AJAX by the MediaElement library. 

*The reason*
Cordova for iOS uses WKWebView to display the content. The Moodle app downloads the content to the device and serves the files locally. Due to iOS CORS restrictions the XHR.status result for local files which are requested via AJAX is always 0 - even if the XHR.responseText holds the correct caption text.

- The files in the editor are part of the get_entries WS response
- We need to download them and re-upload them upon every edition (like we currently do for assignment)
- So when a user is going to save the updates in the app we have to upload all the editor files via webservice/upload.php to get a draftid that will be used as a parameter of the Web SErvice, example parameters (this is for web, for mobile we have to use the WS signature parameters):

    [rid] => 1

dpalou,2018-10-09T12:31:52.000+0000,ragusa87,"Hello,

One of our client is having issue while processing quizz.

They handle an exam session based on quizz on IOS devices with the iPad Moodle application. Every student uses his/her own login to process the quizz. They have around 20 devices at the same time communicating with the Moodle instance over wifi. The exam is taken by various students once a week. Every time, they have a few students (around 5) with an error on the iOS application.  The text show this error message:

{{You have entered data outside the normal sequence. This can occur if you use your browser's Back or Forward buttons; please don't use these during the test. It can also happen if you click on something while a page is loading. Click <strong>Continue</strong> to resume.}}{{(submissionoutofsequencefriendlymessage)}}

 

We were unable to reproduce this error on a regular basis. Sometimes it occurs, sometimes it doesn’t. We were able to reproduce three times using the “Back button” (top left) while answering the quiz. We did not find a way to reproduce this problem systematically and tested different things. So the process below may not be accurate.

HOW TO REPRODUCE
 * Create a Quiz with 3 pages
 * Configure the mobile app.
 * Attend a quiz from the Mobile App
 * Answer the first question
 * Submit your question
 * Answer you second question
 * Press the back button.

WHAT TO EXPECT
 * The screen should be back on the previous question

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS
 * An Alert message is shown with the flowing text:  {{You have entered data outside the normal sequence. This can occur if you use your browser's Back or Forward buttons; please don't use these during the test. It can also happen if you click on something while a page is loading. Click <strong>Continue</strong> to resume}}

 

We are sure that every student use his/her own account and that the problem is not a student having the same quizz open on two different iPads. The problem seems to occur only on IOS as we were not able to reproduce the error on Android.

 

We got a generic message into the log, nothing helpful.

{{Database transaction aborted automatically in webservice/rest/server.php}}

 

We would like some help to resolve this issue. We know that it is difficult to reproduce, and we would like some feedback to invest this issue further.

I installed the new version 3.5.2 of the Moodle app. For a workshop I need to get audio statement from the participants. I installed the Audio Recorder app from Sony on my Android tablet and everything looks well.

I opened the Moodle app and connected to a Moodle 3.5.1+ (20180817). The course for the workshop has a forum with a 50 MB upload. I created a new entry, added some text and opened the dialog to add an attachment. I choose Audio and got the Audio Recorder. The recording works but when the recording is ready and should be loaded into Moodle the mobile Moodle app crashes.

Hemos detectado un bug en la app de Moodle (versión 3.5.1), tanto en IOS como en Android.

Al intentar acceder a los SCO de un contenido formativo en formato SCORM 1.2 a través de un dispatch y se marcan como visualizados con el tick verde los SCO sin que ni siquiera hayan cargado (por incompatibilidad con la app) sin aportar ningún registro de tiempo ni calificación.

Entendemos que Moodle debe controlar la incompatibilidad del contenido y no debe marcar como visualizado un contenido al que ni siquiera se ha podido acceder por un problema de incompatibilidad.

La versión de la Moodle es 3.1.1.
 Los contenidos formativo son del fabricante CAE.NET
 Podemos facilitar un usuario demo si lo necesitan para reproducir el error.

Quedamos a vuestra disposición para colaborar en la resolución del bug y esperamos noticias.

Muchas gracias.

It happens that for courses with few contents this looks very bad, for example, using an iPad or with the Desktop version, a student the first time he access the course he will see only the general section that usually has only a forum (so the 80% of the screen will be empty), and then he will have to do more clics (two more) to open the sections/topic selector and to choose a section. 

We are discussing this and we believe that we should improve it, there are two ways:
1. Add a new option to course formats to be able to configure this at Moodle level
2. Make the app to detect when it should display all the sections for small courses.
3. Infinite scrolling

1. is not desirable, Moodle has too many options already and also there were performance reasons why we decided to stop showing all sections (make the app super slow and it was a really bad user experience)

3. Is very complex to achieve, this is one of the more complex pages and adding infinite scrolling would be very complex.

2. This is my initial proposal form when a user access to a course:

Check if there is an active section/topic -> 
  If there's one, show it
  If not ->
     Check the course format options to see if the course is configured to show only one section at the same time
        If is configured in that way -> Show the general section
        If not -> Calculate the number of activities in the course
        If is a phone and there are less than X activities -> Show all
        If is a tablet/desktop and there are less than Y activities -> Show all
        If there are more than X or Y activities -> Show the general section

Option 2 have some potential issues as pointed by Dani:
* Course with hidden activities for students, the teacher will see them so the total number of activities to do the calculation will be different for students and teachers and this can lead to have a different default view for teachers / students
* Conditional activities. If you unlock some activities, the next time you enter to the course the default view may change because know you have X+1 activities",Improvement,Minor,jleyva,2019-01-11T15:46:57.000+0000,6,Closed,Done,"Show ""All sections"" by default in courses with few activities",2019-03-19T08:39:55.000+0000,MOBILE-2554,,MOBILE,"['com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@497060f8[id=170,rapidViewId=43,state=CLOSED,name=Moodle Mobile 3.6.0,startDate=2018-09-12T23:53:33.454Z,endDate=2018-11-06T06:39:00.000Z,completeDate=2019-02-07T11:09:45.209Z,activatedDate=2018-09-12T23:53:33.454Z,sequence=170,goal=]']"

Yes, I can see the name of the current website if I tap on the most right menu item with the three points but not on the start page. There is also no need to show the string ""Course overview"" when the menu items ""Timeline"" or ""Courses"" are chosen.

In Moodle Mobile, when accessing a numerical question within a quiz, it is not possible to select the corresponding unit, defined in the question. The drop-down-menu or combobox is not shown in Moodle Mobile, yet it is shown in the regular desktop view, which can be accessed by a regular webbrowser.

*Steps to reproduce:*
 # In Moodle, enter a course as a trainer, and create a test.
 # In this test, create a question, which has the ""Numerical"" question format.
 # Enter a name, a text, some valid answers and define two units.
 # In section ""Unit handling"" set ""Unit handling"" to ""The unit must be given, and will be graded.""
 # Set ""Units are input using"" to ""a multiple choice selection"" _or_ ""a drop-down menu"".
 # Access the test in the Moodle Mobile App and open the defined question.

*What I expect:*
 * I expect to enter a valid answer and choose the corresponding unit by interaction with an element in the user-interface, as it is shown in the desktop view (see attached screenshot).

*What actually happens:*
 * I can only enter text into the textfield, but no drop-down menu or multiple choice selection is shown (see attached screenshot), so that I can not choose the corresponding unit.

I investigated this a bit and I think the reload isn't caused by the iframe. It also happened to me in a really simple SCORM, so I looked at the SCORM code and there wasn't any refresh in there. Then I added 'sandbox=""allow-scripts""' to the iframe and it's still reloading, so I guess it's something related to Angular, Ionic or our code.

I debugged the code step by step using Chrome Dev Tools and I wasn't able to find out why is it being reloaded. I also added some _console.log_ to the file _node_modules/@angular/platform-browser/esm5/platform-browser.js_, in some functions that could cause the reload, but none of them were called during this refresh.

as i know truecaller provides api for authentication

1 connect moodle mobile api to truecaller api

Also, the app should be logged out when closed, or this should be an option that can be forced.  If a student closes the app, or powers off the device but does not log out, the next student who opens the app should not be logged on with the other student's username.  I think this is a security issue where students share devices.

Recently the moodle mobile app has had major improvements and I am trying to have students skip many of those steps to save time  and have students use the app to take pictures directly and submit then in an attach file area.  This works really well for drop box submissions, but in quiz essay questions with the attach file option available, the functionality of this is not supported by the app. 

 

*Currently - Drop box's attach file area*

I can open the moodle mobile app via my phone and go into a drop box.  In there I can attach a file and since I am using my phone I can take a picture of work done on paper.  This method directly uploads the submission to the drop box without using roundabout methods.

*Improvement Needed - Quiz Essay Question's attach file area*

Right now, when using the app, I can go into a quiz and input answers but when I go to a essay question (made using Moodle 3.3) that has a attach file area enabled, the mobile app says ""this functionality is not supported""  It would be amazing to have the essay question's attach file area have the same functionality in the mobile app as a drop box does.

We've noticed that parameters included as element of items are included in ""extradata"" array (with isvisible element) but is not included in ""launch"" field in sco objects, so SCORMS doesn't have same behavior in Moodle Mobile app as in Moodle 3.3.1 (and in previous versions since 1.9 we've tested).

However, app loads correctly in ""sco.launch"" parameters included as part of field href in resources.

To reproduce: Include compulsory parameters for correct behavior of the scorm in the field parameters of an item, and add parameters in href field of the resource of another item (a clone without field parameters) and compare.

when a course activity is not supported by the mobile app then the app opens the course activity in the standard browserand the user is automatically logged in. This is a very nice feature!

When the user opens the website via the main menu item ""Website"" then the standard browser opens but the user is not logged in. Please add the auto-login also for the open process to the website. The user is logged in in the app and he should be logged in in the browser when he opens the website on this way.

I think that this improvement should be added because it is a mistake in the application design when an activity opens the browser with an auto-login and the main menu item ""Website"" opens the browser without an auto-login.

noeldemartin,2017-06-28T04:52:28.000+0000,krause,"Hi,

what do you think about the idea using geolocation in Moodle Mobile? With geolocation or gps we could get a little bit of gamification into Moodle.

In a course we can allow or disallow the access to a resource, to an activity or to a complete course section with conditions. There is a condition to do something with the mobile app or to do it only with the browser. Also I found conditions for access if someone is member of a group or if he got a activity completion.

I 'm looking forward for a condition that someone must be at the right geolocation to get a resource or to get a badge. Yes, there is the course format ""format_gps"". This course format can hide course sections and it shows them only at the correct place. The problem is that this feature looks fine in a browser but the feature does not work in Moodle Mobile.

The format_gps was an idea from Jürgen Kappus, ka:media in Düsseldorf, Germany. 
[https://moodle.org/plugins/format_gps]

To show the features Jürgen made some films about his idea.
[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W2dSdzp_b4A]

But it is not as flexible as cordova-plugin-media ([api here|https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-media]). 
 
The media-capture plugin uses the device's default recorder, and does not allow programmatic control of recording, specifically stopping the recording.
 
In many language learning applications the user needs to see the screen at the same time as they are recording. One of the applications I developed for Sojo University in Japan, is called ""Read Aloud"" ([available here|https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_readaloud]). It is an evaluation tool for oral fluency. In this the user needs to read from the screen as they are recorded. But using the media-capture plugin, we would need to leave the ""Read Aloud"" page to perform the recording using the native record screen.
 
Another app that is under development for Sojo is called ""Fluency Builder."" In this app we need to programatically start and stop recording, because we simulate the demands of a real conversation. But using the media-capture plugin we do not have control to stop the recording, as well as the fact the the user must record on another screen out of context.
 
And the Poodll plugins for Moodle are a general recording tool. Teachers use them in many ways, so a mobile app implementation would ideally behave as close as possible to the desktop version, so that the same activity could be used in MMA and browser.
 
The Cordova-plugin-media-capture is not flexible enough for these cases really. But Cordova-plugin-media appears to be more so.  It would be great if the Mobile app could include the media plugin so that these apps could be supported.  ",Improvement,Minor,jhunt,,1,Open,To Do,Add cordova-plugin-media to Mobile app,2017-06-24T16:34:42.000+0000,MOBILE-2152,,MOBILE,

dpalou,2017-05-24T18:11:13.000+0000,dpalou,"With the check updates WS, we now have a new problem regarding activities that can be prefetched and done in offline.

When the user generates some data in the app, the WS check_updates detects that there are some changes in the data (the one that was created by the app) so the activity is marked as outdated.

This is a major problem in scorm, lesson and quiz, since we require the user to have the data up to date before being able to continue the activity. This causes the following behaviour:
 # The user prefetches the activity.
 # The user opens the activity in online and generates some new data.
 # The user leaves the activity and goes offline.
 # The user tries to continue the activity in offline. He can't because the activity isn't up to date.

For lesson I thought we could be able to store the last time we prefetched the pages viewed/answered (not the whole module) and then compare that value with the result of check_updates, but the check_updates WS only returns the IDs of the items, not the date so it isn't possible.

The only option left is to re-download the whole module everytime the user leaves the activity, but that can increase the data usage a lot, specially if some file changes while the user was doing the activity. Maybe we should re-download only if the user is on wifi? Should we add a new setting?

It seems Android is quite good Display > Font Size & Display Size do have an effect on the app. The iOS version of the app doesn't seem to support dynamic type which is required to take advantage of iOS font size changes.

It would be great if students could customise their view a little further than font size. I'm thinking of students with Specific Learning Difficulties or Visual Impairments where changing foreground / background colours and font sizes could make a big difference to the usability of the app for them.

As a basic solution if a student could select from a list of preset style sheets under settings (specified by an administrator under Plugins > Web services > Mobile) eg. ""Green bg, Yellow fg, 130%"", ""Cream bg, Dk Blue fg, 125%"" etc. This would be a good starting point (obviously not ideal but maybe a good place to start).

Ultimately it would be great to have an Aa icon right next door to the search icon which introduced functionality similar to the excellent Moodle accessibility block.

I created a new course in Moodle and saved a file resource. I took the ""Raspberry Pi - Project Book v2"" again. The file has 46 MB. [https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi-issues/Projects_Book_v2.pdf]

I made a backup in Moodle which has 41.8 MB. I did this to see how Moodle will save the resource. Then I saved the same file again within a folder resource. I have two resources in my course. And I made a backup again ... 41.8 MB for both resources. Moodle uses a file management and does not save the same file twice.

In the mobile app I deleted all memory for the website. I logged in and needed 670 kB for this website in the app. I downloaded both resources into the mobile app ... it needed 45.9 MB for the first resource and 91.2 MB for both resources. The app downloaded and saved the same file more than only once.

This takes double time, double download data and double memory size in the app. Is there any way to change this fact? I do not know if the files are marked with a hash string or something else.

in my demo course I have some resources to show that they are usable offline. When my iPad is offline everything looks fine. There is a text page with an embedded locally saved film, a file resource with a big pdf document and a folder resource with some subfolders and files in it. All resources are shown very fast in offline mode.

I found that it takes very long time to open the files when the iPad is online. To open the pdf document ""Raspberry Pi Projects Book v2"" takes 4 minutes. [https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi-issues/Projects_Book_v2.pdf] ... I took this book as an example because it's free and creative commons and someone can read it when he does not like my workshop. :)

The document has 204 pages, 46 MB, and it's save locally in the moodle website as you wrote in the documentation for ""mobile friendly moodle courses"". I think the file is reloaded from the moodle website again but the document was not changed on the website ... and that 's not a good idea.

In my school we have an internet connection with only 16 megabits/s for more than 1500 persons. Everybody must switch of his internet connection to get the preloaded resources from the mobile app. And he has to switch on the internet connection to look into online resources like a database or a feedback. This will not work!

Everything works fine with Moodle Mobile. When I put an ePub file into a course folder then the ePub file is synchronised for offline use on iPad or iPhone. When I try to open an ePub in Moodle Mobile then I can open the ePub with another app like iBooks or Book Creator. This is okay but I will see the ePub icon in the folder and not only empty icon items,

All the icons from Moodle should be shown when a specific file is uploaded into a folder or file resource.

,2017-02-10T10:33:08.000+0000,zac_qin,"In page module, when a page description is not empty, it should be displayed when people clicked to view the page, it works fine in website, description is displayed in the page, but it doesn't display in mobile app. When the description contains video or something else important, it could be a malfunction, because the inconsistency between web and mobile app and missed out the infomation.

I did some research about this.
1.Checked with core_course_get_contents API, found that no description returned in the module area.
2.Edit the module in website, make sure Appearance->Display page description is ticked.
3.Putted a lot of effort to look into the code, start from the core_course_get_contents method, tracked down to page_get_coursemodule_info in ~/moodle/mod/page/lib.php found the real problem. There is nothing to do with $printintro which should be combined with $coursemodule->showdescription to determine whether to passed $info->content(the description) to the caller.

To conclude,
The really problem is it doesn't put description into the API result when $printintro doesn't play a role.
To correct it, write like this in page_get_coursemodule_info method:
if ($coursemodule->showdescription || $printintro) {
        // Convert intro to html. Do not filter cached version, filters run at display time.
        $info->content = format_module_intro('page', $page, $coursemodule->id, false);
        $info->showdescription = true;
}
Maybe it's just a walk around, but it do solved the problem, if there's a better way please kindly to point out. 
I really hope in next version, the problem could be solved, thanks in advance, cheers.

However, I have noticed that these question load very slowly on the mobile app, especially when the question also contains an image file. Although the question load well via the browser (including mobile browsers), loading times of more than 20 seconds sometimes occur when using the app. To determine if this issue was caused by the size of the embedded audio files, I experimented with various file sizes ranging from 20KB to 200KB. I also experimented with a mix of audio and image files. In my testing, smaller audio files loaded slightly faster than larger ones. There was a much larger effect on loading time, however, when audio and image files were mixed in a single question. 

Steps to replicate the problem:
1) create a quiz 
2) add a multiple choice question containing an audio and image file in the Question text area and audio files in the Choice 1, Choice 2 and Choice 3 fields (note: the fields must be in HTML format)
3) start an attempt on the quiz using the Moodle Mobile app

There is an issue with the appium-windows-driver and quick fix for that is restricting the version by ""^1.4.0 <1.6.0"".

* Start the Setup the Moodle Mobile Dev env from [here|https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Setting_up_your_development_environment_for_Moodle_Mobile_2]

*What actually happened* : Facing quite a bit of issues, this being the third one .



Whats mysterical is, I had already setup the entire env without any errors 24 hrs ago, and its running well then. Now when I am starting server, ionic din't even serve.

It does work with 1.5.3, but not with 1.6.0, so a breaking change must have happened.

The issue has been reported in the appium repo: https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/6992
The appium readme states that node version 4 or greater is required, so the only solution seems to be locking the version to less than 1.6.0 or upgrading node.

MOBILE-1796 will solve this issue.

Otherwise, this patch will work around it:

pferre22,2016-07-25T17:12:15.000+0000,elaclare,"In certain contexts it is common to use audio files instead of text as response options in a multiple choice question. Simply put, test-takers *hear * the choices rather than read them. At present the mobile app does not support the use of audio files as choices in MC quiz questions. When the test-taker attempts to play the audio file, a check appears indicating that an answer has been selected. The app is not able to distinguish an attempt to start the audio player from an attempt to select the choice as the correct answer. 

Steps to replicate the problem:
1) create a quiz 
2) add a multiple choice question containing audio files in Choice 1, Choice 2 and Choice 3 fields (note: the fields must be in HTML format)
3) start an attempt on the quiz using the Moodle Mobile app
4) attempt to play the files contained in the choices

I expected to be able to listen to the various response options for the question and then choose an answer. However, I was only able to select answers without being able to listen to the choices.

Greetings,

We've been trying to use the Moodle Mobile app with our SSO enabled Moodle installation. We needed to [enable authentication using SSO methods|https://docs.moodle.org/31/en/Moodle_Mobile_additional_features#Enable_authentication_for_sites_using_SSO_methods_.28like_Shibboleth_and_CAS.29] for it and now we correctly see the browser opening when we enter our site address in the app.

However, we noticed when we have HTTPS available (available, not enforced) on our server, the app never quite returns from the browser and we end up with the Moodle mobile site in the browser itself after SSO login is complete. Disabling HTTPS entirely fixes this behaviour, and we're correctly brought back to the app as soon as we've entered our SSO credentials in the browser.

We've tried this with and without enforcing login from Site Administration and we've always observed the exact same behaviour.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
# Install Moodle, along with the [Moodle Mobile additional features|https://docs.moodle.org/31/en/Moodle_Mobile_additional_features] plugin
# Add an SSL certificate to Apache configuration
# Install, configure and enable the Shibboleth NativeSP Apache module for SAML based SSO
# [Enable authentication for sites using SSO methods|https://docs.moodle.org/31/en/Moodle_Mobile_additional_features#Enable_authentication_for_sites_using_SSO_methods_.28like_Shibboleth_and_CAS.29]
# Install Moodle Mobile on Android
# Enter site hostname in the app, click connect
# At this point a browser opens and we're presented with the SSO login page
# Enter SSO credentials, the browser remains open, now with the Moodle mobile site on it

The following workaround fixes the issue for us:
# Disable HTTPS on Apache configuration OR
# Return 403 on the path /login/token.php using the following Apache directive: 
{code}
<Location /login/token.php>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{HTTPS} on
        RewriteRule (.*) http://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [F]
</Location>
{code}

I suspect it's an issue with the Referer header getting lost when we go from HTTPS->HTTP pages[^this code?^|https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/MOODLE_31_STABLE/login/index.php#L270], and consequently we end up on the /my/ path in the absence of a correct $SESSION->wantsurl.",Bug,Minor,rohitshriwas,2016-12-15T01:04:19.000+0000,6,Closed,Done,"Moodle Mobile, login not returning to app when using SSO authentication on an HTTPS site",2016-12-15T01:04:19.000+0000,MOBILE-1648,,MOBILE,

This is similar to MOBILE-1425.

Steps to reproduce:

# Set the type of login to ""Via a browser window"" in the local plugin settings
# Build a custom app with a fixed URL in www/config.json (parameter ""siteurl"").
# Install and launch the app in a device.
# Log in with any user.
# Delete the token created for this user from the mdl_external_tokens table.
# Pull to refresh the list of courses.
# The dialog with text ""Your authentication token is invalid or has expired [...]"" is shown. Click ""OK"" and enter the username / password in the browser.

Result:
The same dialog is shown again. If you click ""Cancel"" you can continue to use the app as normal, already logged in. If you click ""OK"" the browser window is launched again.

If the calls failed because the device was offline we could re-try them when the device goes online, but what happens if the requests failed because the server was down or something? Maybe we should re-try them every certain time as long as the device is connected.

Also, Juan suggests that the user should be able to see the queue, force a re-try and also delete some requests from the queue.

Can anyone help me please,
I am using moodle 2.5 and i have tried to activate moodle mobile, but when i run the mobile application i get the error ""Moodle Mobile Additional features check returned an unexpected response, you will be authenticated using the standard Mobile service"" ... 
As per Moodle documentation to enable Moodle Mobile Application, we tried all the following cases and it was not working:
1-	In Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Web services > Mobile tick the 'Enable web services for mobile devices' checkbox, then click the button to save changes.
Source: https://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Mobile_app;

2-	Using Moodle Mobile additional features (plugin) without “Mobile app Push Notifications”:
•	Unpack the zip file into the local/ directory. A new directory will be created called local/mobile. 
•	Go to Site administration > Notifications to complete the plugin installation. 
•	Go to Site administration > Plugins > Web services > Mobile, enable ""Enable web services for mobile devices"" (Remember to save the changes) 
•	Go to Site administration > Plugins > Web services > External services, edit ""Moodle Mobile additional features"" and check the ""Enabled"" field, then save changes. 
•	Go to Site administration > Users >Permissions Define roles, edit the Authenticated user role and allow the capability moodle/webservice:createtoken. 
•	Note: You need to have upgraded the Moodle Mobile app to version 1.4.4. 
If you are currently using the Moodle Mobile app, you will need to log out of all your sites in order for the app to detect the new service
Source: https://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Moodle_Mobile_additional_features;

3-	Using Moodle Mobile additional features (plugin) with “Mobile app Push Notifications”:
Similar to second case, in addition I installed “Mobile app Push Notifications” but in its configuration, by clicking "" Request access key”  I got (""An error occurred while retrieving key. Your Moodle site must be registered with Moodle.org to use this service. You may need to re-register to update your details there.""). Note: The system is already registered to Moodle.org, in addition I reregistered it and message still appears.

For example, we can have a background process that for every course check if they are new grades, new events in the calendar, course contents or if your completion status criteria has changed since your last access/check.

We don't need external services for doing that, we can just do the request not using the cache and comparing the result with the cached ones. If the hash/content is different we can alert the user (we can even implement this as an interfice/hook in every course plugin so each plugin is responsible of checking this).

in lack of a better suited feedback-channel I ask this this way.
(maybe somebody feels responsible to improve this part of moodle)

I'm a teacher and want to use moodle-mobile.
So I installed moodle-mobile on my smartphone connected to the moodle-server of our school and logged in as me as a trainer. 

Now to check how my courses are presented to students I havwe a student-login myself.
But I haven't found any possability to login with my student-account. Whenever I start moodle-mobile i get logged in automatically. useful feature for a fast connection in all regular cases but if I want to login as a ""test-student"" do I really have to use another smartphone or is there a smarter way to do it.

best regards

# Create a glossary and a few entries
# Enable glossary autolinking on filter, and entries

- You are sent to the app addon _glossary_ (which does not exist at this stage)

*Actual*

- The link is open in a browser window, and the user needs to log into the website.

We have two solutions here. Re-using the delegate used in notifications that maps an external link with a local addon, and parsing the content. Or developing some sort of SSO which allows a user to be automatically logged in when the open a link from the app. The first solution is the best in terms of user experience in my opinion.

# In mod_page and mod_book there are two calls to $mmUtil.showErrorModal without the translate param set to true. That means that messages 'mma.mod_book.errorchapter' and 'mma.mod_page.errorwhileloadingthepage' are not translated.
# When we open a not downloaded page/resource/book/imscp *two* error messages are shown: one by course_content_handler (download failed) and another shown by the controller (failed to load). I think 1 modal should be enough. This one can be a bit tricky to fix.
# When doing a pull to refresh on notifications, the message ""There are no notifications"" is briefly shown.
# If I go to notifications and click ""View"" on a forum notification in offline, I go to a page with the text: NaN undefined NaN. (Forum not cached).
# If I go to a forum from course contents in offline an empty page is shown but no error message is shown. (Forum not cached).
# If I go to a mod_assign in offline I can see ""No due date"" and ""Add submission"". I think we shouldn't see them. (Assign not cached).
# If I see a not cached participant in offline, the picture sometimes is not shown (it should have been cached in participants list).
# Add/Block contact in offline don't show an error message and the button text moves a bit.
# If I add a note but the request fails I lose all the text I wrote.
# The last message in a discussion is behind the ""Send"" button.
# $mmSitesManager gets $mmApp DB when it's initialized. This might be too soon in some cases, it should be retrieved when it's needed.
# In contacts view, search cannot be cleared if no results found.
# I go to discussions list, I see last message in a discussion is ""A"". I go into the discussions, I add new messages (or the other sends new messages). When I go back to discussions list, the last message is still ""A"" (is not updated unless I pull to refresh).
# In a discussion, when the keyboard is opened it hides the last messages, I have to scroll to see them. IMO they should move along with the keyboard, so they're still visible.
# There's a problem in mod_page if the module has some resources that are not shown on the page. If the user downloads it using the download icon it works fine, since it downloads all the files. But if the user accesses the page, the course handler waits for ALL the resources to be downloaded, but we only download the ones shown. We need to fetch all the page resources like we do in book and so (this can affect mod_resource too).

fred,2015-06-16T21:43:42.000+0000,dpalou,"As discussed on MOBILE-831, we need an app init process to be able to know the app is initialized. Fred comments about this:

# Creating a place where we can register init process
# Those init process need to return promises
# All those init processes need to be registered before the following:
# An event is triggered once all the init process have been resolved/rejected

I believe we cannot limit the init processes to .config(), and .run() is pretty async so it's hard to predict when our 'checkInit' needs to be run. But for sure we need to register at least one init process before we call 'checkInit', and once checkInit is finished we need to go through the init processes to see if any new one was added. The init processes need to register a function which will return a promise, they should not call the promise straight. 'checkInit' will trigger an event resolving the promise of $mmApp.ready(), or $mmApp.initialised() or something.",Improvement,Minor,dpalou,2015-07-29T19:26:24.000+0000,6,Closed,Done,"Implement an app ""init process""",2017-02-09T16:45:29.000+0000,MOBILE-1079,,MOBILE,

There's a problem with this approach: if the fetch request fails and the data is not cached, we end up with infinite failed calls to WS, because once we broadcast 'scroll.infiniteScrollComplete' the request is performed again.

The easy way to fix it would be setting this if the request fails:

{noformat}$scope.canLoadMore = false;{noformat}

This'll make infinite-loading to disappear forever, so the user'll have to do a pull to refresh or something to re-enable it. 

Another option would be to replace the infinite-loading with a ""Load more"" button if a request fails. That way we stop the infinite executions and we still allow the user to retry it. If the user clicks ""Load more"" and the request succeeds, we'd show the infinite-loading again.

So basically, I see that there are 3 alternatives for retrieve all the information needed for building the form:
# Creating new external functions matching Moodle APIs, (groups_get_activity_allowed_groups, groups_get_activity_groupmode, has_capability, etc..)
PROS: Since they are generic, we can reuse them in other areas
CONS: Lot of logic and requests required in the code
# Creating a new external function (generic) for retrieving all the user permissions and group status in a forum (so we retrieve in a single request all the information we need to build the form)
PROS: With a single request we'll retrieve all the information we need
CONS: It solves the request problem, but we still need complex logic for creating the form and we will need a new external function for every form
# Retrieving all the Quickform elements generated in the  post_form.php (including name, type, maxchars, validation rules, disabling rules, etc..)
PROS: We will be able to reuse the logic everywhere (for any moodle form)
CONS: It will require to implement a local framework for creating angularforms via quickform settings

moodlewssettingfilter = true

In the current app we apply filters locally in the app (just the multilingual filter, not other filters).

We have to evaluate if we should start to retrieve the text filtered or if we should filter the text once is in the app, this has some pros and cons:

If we apply filters in the app:
- We are limited to apply only the core filters
- We have to replicate lot of code for complex filters
- We are not going to be able to support filters that requires software to be installed in the server 
- We will have to implement web services for retrieve filter settings (like censored words)
- We are not going to support contributed filters

- Not all the text filtered is suitable to be displayed in the app

We should implement something like that in MM2 too, otherwise the user will find that all his requests fail. There's a TODO comment in $mmWS.call where those cases should be treated.

I don't like using $rootScope, so another solution I thought is to implement a $mmEvents service. This service would provide functions to listen (register) and to trigger an event. In $mmWS.call we could do something like $mmEvents.trigger('mm_invalid_session'), and then somewhere else listen for that event to logout the user and redirect to login page.

# $mmUtil should not need a reference to $mmSite, if $mmUtil::fixPluginFile needs a token, it should always be passed a token.
#- Could we rename fixPluginFile to fixPluginFileURL at the same time? :)
# I don't really like $mmUtil.showErrorModal as it will quickly hit issues where we have to pass a lot of parameters to it. If we really want to abstract the modal system, then let's make it a whole service or so. Though I would vote for a guideline and using inline $ionicPopup or whatever else.
#- Same goes with loading IMO.
# Why is $mmUtil a provider? Does it need to be used during scaffolding?
# Method $mmUtil.isPhone is redundant is we keep $ionicPlatform.isTablet (app.js)

*App.js*

# I would leave that almost blank, leaving pretty much only what Ionic has added. Everything that core adds should be in core/main.js
# We should decide whether or not we define the global dependencies in app.js, or in core/main.js. Example: pascalprecht.translate which is likely to be used by third parties too should probably be in app.js.

*General*

# We should avoid using $mmConfig as a temporary storage to pass data between controllers/services etc... it is probably better to define a basic store where we need it, and request back the value from where it was defined. (Noticed that with mmLogin vs. mmSiteManager)
# Can I suggest the following file naming convention?

Moodle content is not processed through Moodle filters when accessed through the Moodle Mobile App (tested on Android). 

*Description*
It is not currently possible to display content that is normally processed through filter, like multilangsecond and generico, in the mobile app. Instead, you see the unfiltered markup tags in the mobile app.

This issue was recently reported in the Moodle forums. See https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=311725

*What I expected*
I expected course configuration and content to be available in the mobile app as it is in a browser.

*Why we need this fixed*
We have a desire to deploy our courses using the mobile app. All of the courses on our website are multilingual using the \{mlang\} tags. At the moment, we can't even offer our courses in one language without modifying all aspects of the courses.

,2015-01-11T20:54:42.000+0000,jleyva,"Several current external functions does not launch events, this means that not logging is done for users.

This is problematic, since some other plugins may depend on events launched by plugins (like forum) and the course log is not populated with this information (MOBILE-782).

Note that a web service can be executed as a single USER or as an admin account, we can detect if an USER is the one launching the Web Service and in that case launch the event, example:

{code}
$event = \mod_forum\event\course_module_viewed::create($params);
    $event->add_record_snapshot('course_modules', $cm);
    $event->add_record_snapshot('course', $course);
    $event->add_record_snapshot('forum', $forum);
    $event->trigger();
{code}

This can be problematic, because in some cases maybe is not the real USER who is calling the Web Service, imaging a SIS that is caching all the messages posted by an user or something like that.

There are several ways to fix these:
- Force external functions to launch events always. (Maybe adding a new mandatory parameter ""logging or launchevents"" to say if the information must be logged)
- Create new external functions for launching events in the system (so the client must launch events manually after doing some actions)

could it be possible to add an option to set the browser app? 

The standard browser for iOS devices is Safari. The Safari browser only uploads files from the camera roll (jpg, png, mp4, m4v). But the Safari browser is not able to upload all other files (for example txt, doc, pdf, epub, zip).

Therefor we are using iCab mobile. This is an alternative browser which can upload every file format. It would be nice if we could start the Moodle session with Moodle mobile and for all browser use we can choose the browser app by a optional setting in Moodle mobile.

- Plugin: For making the code more ""simple"" and maintainable. Moodle has to send the full message to Airnotifier
- Airnotifier: Add support to ""message formatters"" plugins or something like that, because Moodle will requiere specific formatting of the message. Airnotifier installation should add basic ""message formatters"" plugins and we can create the custom ones for Moodle.

The benefit is that if we need to update or add new platforms we have to make changes only in the Airnotifier ""message formatters""",Improvement,Minor,jleyva,2014-11-05T19:56:53.000+0000,5,Resolved,Done,Remove specific payload format in the message_airnotifier plugin,2017-02-09T16:47:28.000+0000,MOBILE-579,,MOBILE,

jleyva,2014-02-12T18:00:42.000+0000,jleyva,"Martin is interested in having a way of pulling from Moodle all the notifications you should've received in your Mobile device.

This is interesting because:
* If Airnotifier is not working or there are problems in APNS you may lose notifications.  Pulling them is 100% accurate.
* notifications are often truncated to fit mobile restrictions.
* For mobile devices without support for PUSH notifications, like Android initially, this can be a way for pulling notifications from Moodle

It cannot be guaranteed that the learning itself will warn the user that connectivity has been lost therefore we need to handle this within the application.

For a good user experience we should not ask for username and passwords again. MOBILE-113 is dealing with SSO and this may achieve what we require.

However if this solution does not meet the functionality needed or an SSO authentication method is not installed on the Moodle in question we will need to create a web service to log the user into the site.  We need to take into consideration that the username and password may not have been saved locally (see MOBILE-434) and we will therefore need to work out a different way to achieve this (possibly by using the current token to authenticate the user.)

As not all SCORM is mobile ready, we also propose to add a 'Mobile suitable' flag to the Moodle code to allow the admin to tag which SCORM is mobile suitable and the app would then use this to decide whether it can be launches in the app or not (MDL-41696).

On iOS when we click on the world icon it opens a childbrowser. I think it makes sens to open the Moodle site into the childbrowser when clicking on the non-downloadable content rows too. It provides a very quick access to any file content and it can not break the app (because the childbrowser is a different browser).

On Android, when we click on the world icon it opens an external browser. It can be pretty slow to open an external browser. It's specially annoying because the site is opened in a new tab all the time. As we didn't support custom plugin previously, I suggested to not encourage the access to the external browser, so we removed the direct row click. 

I suggest both system behave this way now:
* each non-downloadable content row opens the childbrowser => no grey row + no need world icon anymore.
* display a bottom bar that let you quickly go back to the app without breaking anything. I saw they patched the childbrowser on android to support it.

Try also with the color version if it looks better. Also add some more space between the button and the site. Also one good thing would be to have an image of the user when you are connected with different user for the same site (super rare it's true).

The Settings -> Sites screen has the site name with asterisk after it, what's the asterisk for?
The page lacks theming, and doesn't explain what the big X is for beside the site name (presumably delete).

* I think it's good to use Moodle icons.
* but I don't like the idea to use a Moodle icon for the purpose to use a Moodle icon, specially if the feature behavior differs, it would be only confusing. Barbara also mentioned Portfolioadd.png that could match the feature too, making me think we are going in the wrong direction trying to absolutely get Moodle icons in the app.

* I think it's ok to use the export icon because if you do a search on google image you can see it's more used for Upload than our current cloud icon. I think it's quite a essential good point.
* but I think it's not great in the sens this icon would be more appropriate for exporting to Dropbox/VLC/... apps than uploading in Moodle.

At the end I would suggest to switch for export.svg because it's more understandable than a cloud image (Moodle site is not considered as Cloud by people) and we still can use standard share icon for export to Dropbox and co. Please, give your opinion ;)

b) I didn't know what was going to happen, it kind of quit the app. I felt frustrated to not be alerted.

Hey, just thought I would clock in to say we are also experiencing this issue. We have 2.2.2 (Build: 20120312), authenticated by ldap and using a self signed SSL Cert while we are in development. All connections are made locally (eg https://ourdomain.local/moodle/). I see a few people refer to a fix with a token.php file, but the forum post linked doesn't seem to mention it, unless I am missing something. Is anyone able to clue me in on this and I'll give it a swing?{quote}

Hi ****

we continue to get 404 message in moodle 2. when clicking on a file uploaded into  my private files from the moodle iphone app. can you please investigate?

REPLY

I think we've already solved this one. It's a bug with Moodle that doesn't like ""+"" symbols in file names otherwise it will return you a 404 not found error.
This is why it happens with all platforms (IE, Chrome and the Apple app)

Please re-test when you get a chance of uploading a file without the plus symbol in the filename and if you still have errors, just log another service desk call and I'll investigate. I've already tested this issue with and without the plus symbol and without appears to work fine.

If i rename the the file and remove the  + then all works fine.

This setting seems to be a hack to prevent attempts to send data when there is no connections. This shouldn't be a setting, it just shouldn't send data when there is no connection. It should queue it.

A setting to set preferences of channels over which to send data would be great. This would allow students/teachers to avoid abusing their expensive connections and send everything when on the school wifi or preferred wifi. It could get more preferences , but for now choosing between 3G and wifi would be very practical imho.

for example:
 Data connections:
  * [on/off] send data over 3G or via mobile broadband service.
  * [on/off] send data over wifi connection.

with this we can explicitly control what the app senses as a valid data connection to send data through.",New Feature,Minor,nebgor,2014-12-09T20:35:48.000+0000,5,Resolved,Done,enable and disable sending data over 3g and over wifi separately.,2017-02-09T16:47:34.000+0000,MOBILE-95,,MOBILE,
