Steps to recreate:
1. Create a blank portal with a 2-3 pages to test
2. Drop 2 HTML modules on the home page and add some dummy content. Edit the settings for one of the modules so it is set to ""Display On All Pages""
3. Navigate to Host&gt;Site Management and export the site, making sure ""Include Content"" is ticked.
4. Generate a child portal using the template
Expected Result: A portal with 2 HTML modules, one displaying on all pages.
Actual Result: A portal with 1 HTML module. The module set to display on all pages does not get created.
Opening up the .template file confirms that the module is getting exported, but something is preventing it from being created when generating a portal from the template. If you find the module instances in the XML and replace &lt;alltabs&gt;true&lt;/alltabs&gt; with &lt;alltabs&gt;false&lt;/alltabs&gt; and generate another portal then the modules show up, albeit without that setting enabled.

In the original code, if AllowNullBannerType is set to true, then code uses provided BannerTypeID value. And if&nbsp; AllowNullBannerType is set to false (this one is default), then code ignores provided BannerTypeID value and uses one from PortalSettings.
So, this code shows no banners at all:

&lt;dnn:BANNER id=""dnnBanner1"" runat=""server"" GroupName=""MyBanners"" BannerTypeId=""4"" BannerCount=""4"" Orientation=""H"" AllowNullBannerType=""true"" /&gt;
Solution is simple - we need to negate condition in this code, to restore sane behaviour, so if we don&apos;t allow null banner type, then BannerTypeId must be specified. And if we allow null banner type, then BannerTypeId must be ignored and PortalSettings used instead.

The module.offset() method was returning null and causing the top property to fail. &nbsp;To resolve this issue, I placed a module check around line 1148 so the final code looks like this:
// fade module if needed
varfadeModule=dnn.dom.getCookie(&apos;FadeModuleID&apos;);
if(fadeModule){
dnn.dom.setCookie(&apos;FadeModuleID&apos;,&apos;&apos;,-1);

KenGrierson,2013-05-30T21:52:00.000-0700,weggetor,"Problem: Often modules have more content in the ""settings"" than in ""content"". I have for example an HTML module with a lot of javascript in the head section of the settings and only one simple canvas element in the content. Exporting content only exports the canvas and nothing else.
Solution: DNN has internal methods for saving a complete page or even a complete website as a template, with all settings. But when exporting and importing module content, these methods are not used. Instead there is a special solution for this which only fetches the content and nothing else.
Attachment: I attached 3 changed files of the core which changes this behaviour to the standard DNN way and allows to export and import a module with all the settings. There are only minor changes in codebehind of export.ascx and import.ascx and 1 new method in ModuleController.cs. If an old template is selected for import, import goes the old way and a new template imports the whole thing with settings and permissions
Enhancements: I did not change the UI of import.ascx. Perhaps it would be a great enhancement to add some checkboxes like: Include Settings, Include Content, Include Permissions. If IncludeContent is checked by default and the others not this is the behaviour like before.

What probably happens is that when you add the social group, it saves somewhere in the db that info (that does not get removed when the social group is removed) and that info is telling the journal that&apos;s it&apos;s slaved to the group, only there&apos;s no groupid, hence the journal is empty.
So we are looking at 2 bugs here - the journal disappearing when the social group is added and the journal not reappearing when the social groups are removed.
although it may have been simple and logical, but I think that to avoid this kind of mixup, the Journal needs to be actually told if it&apos;s reading profile stream or group stream. (no worries trying to guess something by default, but user does need to control these settings).&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Reason for adding social groups to my profil page:
I actually want people visiting my user&apos;s profile to see the list of groups to which the user belongs to. On the same page I display the user&apos;s Journal... &nbsp;I do not want to use third party module for this.&nbsp;

(Build 637)
Currently, the width of the left treeview pane (folder tree) on the left is fixed. User can choose to completely hide the treeview pane or show it in its standard width. But there is no way to adjust to width of this pane.
A scrollbar appears on the bottom, using which the user can scroll to a folder that is buried deep into the subfolders, but this is still very painful to use. I can imagine how difficult this will be when the folder structure is at an enterprise level.
As far as I can remember, I have always hated to scroll horizontally. User gets&nbsp;claustrophobic&nbsp;after a few minutes of using the folder treeview.

Proposed enhancement:&nbsp;&nbsp;

When the treeview pane is visible, the user should be able to adjust the width. On the border, the icon should change to a double-sided arrow in order for the user to drag it.&nbsp;
When the treeview pane is not visible, the user should NOT be able to adjust the width.
When adjusting the width, the user should NOT be able to reduce the width.
When adjusting the width, the user should be able to increase the width to a MAX of double the standard width (no more).
When the toggle button is clicked, the treeview hides completely no matter what the current width of the treeview was.
For every change in width, the horizontal scrollbar should adjust accordingly.
Nice to have: The width of the ""Name"" column on the main gridview should adjust according to the changing width of the treeview panel as the user adjusts the panel widths. The width of all other columns on the gridview stays the same. Now, we are talking!

The procedure that injects the command bar is in Skin.cs. Before doing so, it evaluates two querystring parameters - popup and dnnprintmode. Both of those hide the command bar, but, both also do other things.

The alterings were made to be as compatible with existing code, as well as with DotNetNuke 6.2 standards, as seemingly possible.

These changes are based on DNN 6.2.2&apos;s source code, but since version 6.2.4 is the current latest version of DNN, I have checked if the files that we altered, have been changed by the DNN-team theirselves too. Conclusion is that only our changes in the View.ascx-file will need to be re�mplemented for full compatibility with DNN 6.2.4. That will probably be coming down to little copy/pasting-work, if you catch my drift ;-)

Folder Provider - add a new method: bool IsStorageInstanceSecure(FolderMappingInfo folderMapping)


Why this?
Because
IsStorageInstance depends on the current instance&apos;s properties. It could be in some cases is &apos;true&apos; and in others is &apos;false&apos;.
In the current implementation, the virtual property IsStorageSecure() does not have the current
FolderMappingInfo  data, and therefor cannot know this.
In your PE implementation of Azure and S3 you may not need this. Despite the provider&apos;s settings you allways have
IsStorageSecure = true (or false, I don&apos;t know).


However the information about the current instance being secure or not could be very useful for something using the provider.
For example to wrap a file&apos;s URL into a &apos;linkclick&apos; depending on IsStorageInstanceSecure  being true or not.

If you would like to keep the current
IsStorageSecure()  as it is, then file. But please add the
IsStorageInstanceSecure(FolderMappingInfo folderMapping) .
It&apos;s easy, harmless, and useful.

client.ServicePoint.ConnectionLimit = 1;

Per my conversation with Charles Nurse last week, the new RazorScriptFile method generates a redundant filesystem lookup when .cshtml files are being used (the most common case).


From our email thread:


I don�t have the code handy, but in pseudocode, it�s basically:
&nbsp;
                Make the script filename with .cshtml extension
                Issue filesystem lookup                
                Does it exist?

                                Change it to .vbhtml
                }
                Issue filesystem lookup (again)
                Does it exist?
                No {

                }
                Return success result
&nbsp;
I believe a more optimal way to write that would be:
&nbsp;
                Make the script filename with .cshtml extension
                Issue filesystem lookup

This change was introduced in changeset 61158.


This modification was erroneous, and causes incorrect results when the console module is applied against a multi-level page hierarchy.


Specifically, the subsequent loop assumes an ordering of the following form:


Tab Level 1 Sort 1
Tab Level 1 Sort 2
    Tab Level 2 Sort 1
    Tab Level 2 Sort 2
Tab Level 1 Sort 3
    Tab Level 2 Sort 1
        Tab Level 3 Sort 1


However, the ordering identified above does not perform this sorting.  If the GetTabsBySortOrder call does not return an ordering with recursive grouping (I&apos;m not sure whether it does), additional work will need to be performed to achieve the desired ordering.


At a minimum, the modification should be removed to read:

It occurs when installing skins from the /install/skin folder (via the install.aspx?mode=installresources). When the caching provider attempts to send a cache message to other servers it cannot locate itself so throws an exception.

They have 4 server records in the WebServers table but we are not running in a WebFarm environment.

The site is load balanced over 4 web servers in our test environment but the web farm is disabled.

Even with a single entry in the WebServers table however, the problem still exists.

Looking closely at Source Code, the real reason for the problem was discovered.

The problem lies here - DNN Platform\Library\Common\Initialize.cs on method InitializeApp()

When they deploy to their test environment, the first URL they call is /install/install.aspx?mode=installresources

Because this is the first page to be executed, The InitializeApp method is called and the IsUpgradeOrInstallRequest method returns true.

Crucially, because of this - the Globals.IISAppName is not set.

When the install process then attempts to send a cache clear message, this line below in the WebRequestCachingProvider throws the exception as discussed.

var thisServer = ServerController.GetServers().Single(s => s.ServerName == Globals.ServerName && s.IISAppName == Globals.IISAppName);

They have made a change in our version of the initialize method to always set the Globals.IISAppName and this has resolved the issue for them.

Their other environments work fine because they have health monitors making requests to the home page of servers every 10 seconds. The initialize method is then called which successfully sets the Globals.IISAppName

mohit,2015-12-15T11:46:06.000-0800,jbrinkman,"A moniker is a simple name provided for an objects that simplifies identifying specific object instances.  This concept was first used in Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and the Component Object Model (COM).  

The DNN Services Framework was first introduced in DNN 6.2.  When creating web services with the Service Framework, it is common to require callers to provide the ModuleId and TabId as part of the web request header.  This requirement complicates the programming model since service endpoints become tied to their specific location in a website.  Modules are able to easily retrieve the ModuleId and TabId from the service framework as part of the initial module rendering.  However, this mechanism is not available for remote callers, where the UI rendering is not directly controlled by DNN.

In order to encapsulate this context data and to simplify the programming model for web services, we should introduce the concept of a moniker.  The DNN service moniker will provide a mechanism for mapping a simple name to a specific module instance.  This moniker can then be passed to a web service in place of the ModuleId, TabId or any other context data specific to a module.

The moniker should be implemented as an additional system TabModule setting. By default, the moniker will be composed of the page name, the module definition friendly name and the TabModuleId separated by /.  When composing the default moniker, all spaces should be replaced with dashes.  For example, if the Social Groups module was on the “Community” page with TabModuleId of 100, the default moniker would be “Community/Social-Groups/100”.  

The default moniker implementation provides a human friendly method to identify the page and module being addressed and also a unique element to differentiate between multiple modules on the same page.  The core platform should expose a service endpoint that allows an application to query for monikers related to a specific module type that the current user has permissions to view.

When calling service endpoints that need a specific module context, the moniker will be included as part of the service call.  The service can then use the moniker to easily lookup any context for the module instance associated with the moniker.

*Developer Notes:*
The purpose of this step is to help the back-end to create the DNN context for the web API request. Therefore, it is not tied to any authentication mechanism (like JWT, Basic, Forms, etc.)

Injecting the moniker in the query part of the API request requires modifying all existing API’s that need to use this moniker  but is not feasible and requires making changes to existing core (which we want to completely avoid). What we need is a non-invasive method. One way in which this can be implemented is by adding a new vendor specific header in the request as an alternate way to using the {{TabID}} and {{ModuleID}} that are in use today. Assume we are going to use {{X-DNN-MONIKER}} for this purpose. An example of a full header would be:
{{X-DNN-MONIKER: John’s Blog}}

Before being able to use this feature, there is a need for an API that returns the various monikers associated with a specific module. Let’s say in an EVOQ Engage site if we need to find all the monikers that use the discussions module, say discussions (i.e., all tabs/pages that have the discussions module in them), we will send an API request that returns all of these monikers associated with discussion modules placed on various pages. This call may return zero, one, or more monikers.

There must be a consideration for user rights in every data returned from the API; no private data should be revealed to an un-authorized user.",Story,Low,jbrinkman,2015-12-30T15:38:14.000-0800,6,Closed,Done,Implement Moniker API for Service Framework ,2016-01-21T16:06:14.000-0800,DNN-8141,3.0,dnn,Platform 8.0 - Sprint 14

Often the way this was implemented was by re-using existing user controls in the new Advanced Settings screen.

- X (count required) total characters

Looking at mail server logs it is trying to use the HOST email account instead of the ADMIN for the site portal email account for the TEST email address so it FAILS!

Logging in as ADMIN on the web portal does not give the option to set ""Portal SMTP""

It is very odd as well another thing is on the host account on the HOST SMTP SETTINGS if I put just the SMTP addresss mail.domain.com (to where it will use port 25) it is successful (Which it should not be since i do not have SSL allowed on this port and fails in Outlook)  And when I put mail.domain.com:465 (Which works in OutlooK) it fails.

Just seems like SMTP is all buggered up for HOST and PORTAL.  One last note is there is nothing to tell you to put it in format domain.com:PORT except in the HOST SMTP settings, when you go to Portal the help popup says nothing to give you a clue if your doing it right.  Which I was but it is nice to verify.

Settings should work my mail server is not going to allow email@hostdomain.com to send on email@portaldomain.com SMTP settings.... the test should be matched to the ADMIN account for that portal dont you think?  Or does this only make sense to me.  Maybe we need a chat because this has been a long issue and I am pretty sure everything is ok on my end.  I know you all use other mail servers but this one has to match the SSL certificate which is mail.domain.com for the SMTP and is used for all the email accounts I will be using on all the portals of one of the DNN instances.  It is very odd to see the HOST SMTP test work only and with port 25 instead of the port that is required for SSL on my server...",Bug,High,cody,,1,Open,To Do,Unable to send SMTP email SSL,2016-02-19T10:26:59.000-0800,DNN-7542,3.0,dnn,Platform 8.0 - Sprint 14

i am trying to render a partial view returned by the controller called by jQuey $.ajax. I do get the partial view though, but a few lines below the retuned HTML also contains the full markup of the page where the MVC module resides. The AJAX-Reques-URL is generated by the following statement:

Calling this URL in a browser also displays the partial view plus the page itself below. I have tested my code in a standalone project so I am nearly sure it must be a bug of DNN.

 1. Install the module
 2. Create a new page
 3. Click Modules -> Add module
 4. Search for the module and drag & drop it on the page
 5. Repeat steps 3. and 4. Instead of an additional module nothing happens

If you now delete the first module, the second one will render correctly and if you now undelete the first one from the database (setting IsDeleted = 0), both Will now show correctly until you recycle DNN.

The siteurls.config file contains a series of regex expressions which provide basic rewriting functions in the Url Rewriting process.  These have been around since the introduction of the first url rewriting in Dnn 4.x.   This task is to test and determine if these rewriting rules are required in a new, standard installation.  The purpose is to eliminate the loading, reading and iterative execution of the regex expressions if they are not needed for a base case.   The file will need to be kept for legacy installations and where customers have modified the file.    The purpose is to eliminate the execution of uncompiled regex expressions found in the file.

+Requirements+
* Investigate the shipping of Dnn with the site urls.config file empty with no rewriting expressions at all.  This will require determining if any of the rewrite rules contained within it are still required for normal system function of a standard installation.
* The support of legacy /xyz/tabid/dd/default.aspx Urls is no longer part of the requirements of a new installation.  People with older sites who still need to rewrite/support these will not have a site urls.config modified on upgrade.
* If it is possible to ship a site with an empty site urls.config file, then the installation should not drop into that part of the processing during the url rewriting process.

The IFileManager interface expose the GetContentType method and ContentTypes property. This method/property could be used as well in classes like Folder Provider. Currently use that from the File Manager introduce a cyclical class dependency as the FileManager depends on the abstract FolderProvider class. 

A possible solution could be create a smaller interface in Platform called IFileContentTypeManager that expose the ContentTypes list and the GetContentType method. Then FileManager could use this class internally (maybe marked it as deprecated and point devs the new class). In this way we will apply the Interface Segregation and Single Responsibility principles and improve the dependency graph removing the cyclical dependency in Folder Providers.

{quote}Hi Bing & Ash,
The login cookie issue caused by and edge case and it’s not a real bug, the problem occur caused in that server, all child sites added into a site group but parent site not, so in this case:
1.      When login from child site, cookies will save as local cookie and have expire date;
2.      When login from parent site, cookies will save as session cookie.

In this case, if you both open child site and parent site in different tabs in same browser, and when authentication timeout reached(in web.config, forms node, timeout default value is 60 minutes), membership will try to extend cookie, so that it will create duplicate cookie, you can verify with below steps:
1.      Change web.config, set timeout to 3, so no need wait for a long time;
2.      Open child site and login as host;
3.      Open parent site in another tab in same browser, now it should also already login;
4.      And wait for 5 minutes, then check cookies, you will see 2 cookies.

so we need notice that when create site groups, we need avoid that cookie name may shares with sites which not in site group, and IMO no need code fix for this problem, the  workaround is just close browser and open again.

Is that complete analysis necessary that early?

One reason for the initial trigger is to filter out assemblies that won't load properly as can be read in the class. 
Attached is a modification where a list of such faulty assemblies is computed to a file to avoid that check on each startup, but the catalog is further parsed when parts are later composed in the code, so the performance gain is only from not throwing unnecessary exceptions, which is negligible.

KenGrierson,2015-04-27T19:14:50.000-0700,jbrinkman,"DNN upgrades are based on a 3 part version number representing the platform, major and minor version numbers.  Each version component uses a 2 digit integer with a leading zero for padding (e.g. 01.02.03).  This version number uniquely identifies a release and is used as an identifier when creating database upgrade scripts.  Every release may be composed of numerous builds, any one of which might include database changes.  All database changes are included in a single script for any given version.

This approach to versioning results in difficulty supporting upgrades from Betas to RCs to final release. Also, this script versioning scheme often results in merge conflicts as numerous developers need to edit a common script file.  These merge conflicts complicate accepting community pull requests and in rolling back changes when necessary.

h2. Card
As a developer I want to create a uniquely named database script file for every Pull Request.  The system should automatically apply scripts based on the version number and order number specified in the script name.  Scripts should follow the following naming convention: {Version}.{Order}.sqldataprovider where the {Version} token uses the standard DNN version number and the {Order} token is a simple integer with no padding characters (e.g. 01.02.03.4.sqldataprovider)

h2. Conversation
The system should assume that a script without the order token is applied before any scripts with an order number.

It is the code committers responsibility to ensure that scripts are uniquely numbered when checking in scripts.

* Skins
* Modules
* Libraries
* Language packs
* Imporiting sites from remote templates
* Pages on current portal or any portal.
* Adding modules to pages.
* Changing module details on a page (e.g. Module Title).

This was a crucial step for customers managing multiple portals and multiple installations of DNN. Every time a some user controls on a few modules were updated, deployment used to take about an entire night doing most of these steps manually on all portals and all servers. While now, this can be done in minutes.

This can be done from:

* Command line. A new tool was created called *dnncmd.exe*
* TFS Build Agent. A set of custom TFS Build Agent activies were created in order to publish modules (or extensions) right after the DNN package is created on the TFS build agent.
* From code. A library was created to allow DevOps applications to publish modules to a DNN site from their own code.

On the DNN side, an extension (module) was create to expose a REST interface to accept commands and call DNN API within to process requests. This module was named *DNN Deployer*.

This is a work in progress and there's a lot to do yet. I have been discussing with my clients and I proposed to them and they accepted to make it open source and donate it to you guys so that it might be included as part of the core in a future release.

If you're interested in accepting the donation, I will be more than willing to send it to you.

MVC Modules should behave the same as any other DNN module when it comes to packaging.  An MVC module should be installable using a standard DNN module manifest. Since MVC modules use a controller action as the primary method for rendering content, the manifest should allow the module to define a controller and action to render for specific module controls.

The DNN framework should use the defined controller action to render the requested module control following the standard DNN convention.  While an MVC module may define a number of module controls, it should also be able to programatically define a controller action to use without using a predefined control.

Currently DNN modules use an IActionable interface to define custom module actions which are rendered in the Module Action Menu.  The purpose of the interface is to define a well known method that can be called by the framework to retrieve a collection of actions defined by the module developer.

Each controller action may be used to render a view and thus should be able to define a collection of actions which the framework can retrieve and render.

h2. Conversation
A custom method attribute could be used to identify a method that returns a collection of actions.  The method must implement a predefined signature but could be located in any class which is accessible by the core framework.  It should not be necessary to define the action items in the same controller as the action which relies on the action collection.

The two attributes should be:
* *ModuleActionAttribute* - This attribute is used to define a single Module Action and only supports the most common features of module actions.  This attribute allows the controlkey, icon, security level, and title to be set for the module action. For greater control over all module action functionality, the ModuleActionItems attribute should be used. 
* *ModuleActionItemsAttribute* - This attribute is used to identify a type and a method which can be called by the framework to retrieve a collection of ModuleActions. By convention, if the type is not defined, it will assume the method exists in the controller.  By convention, if the method is not defined, it will assume a method name which corresponds with the action decorated by the Attribute instance (e.g. the Edit action method would have a corresponding GetEditActions method).",Story,High,jbrinkman,2015-03-03T15:43:01.000-0800,6,Closed,Done,Define MVC Module Actions,2015-08-04T21:20:34.000-0700,DNN-6643,5.0,dnn,7.5.0 - Sprint 1

I was working on customer sites upgrading tests, and encountered HTML module editing failure scenario with one of the sites – Howard County Gov. after upgrading from EE 7.2.1 to 7.3.3.112 successfully. The symptom is: 
1)      No exiting contents will be displayed in “Rich Text Editor” mode
2)      In “Rich Text Editor“ mode, user won’t be able to input any characters
3)      Switch to “Basic text box”, html will be displayed.

Especially, when you're developing APIs for tablets, phones and mobile devices, this part of the API really looks dowdy - and makes every DNN based API less memorable and intuitive for the user.

Do you see a way to rename the filepath to something shorter and more “neutral” (like “DM” - or maybe “DNN” (regarding the marketing aspects for the platform itself)) or, even better – maybe by URL-rewriting – simply get rid of this part of the URL, at least for DNN based APIs and API-calls?

Maybe even introduce a new folder called “API” in parallel to the “/DesktopModules/”-Folder (- for the classically developed modules, where the user usually doesn’t see the URL?)..?

- Login as host 
- Add *social.dnndev.me/social* to the list of site aliases in Admin->Site Settings->Advanced Settings-> Site Aliases
- Create a child portal with name ""child1""
- if it is not set, add *social.dnndev.me/social/child1* to the list of site aliases in Admin->Site Settings->Advanced Settings-> Site Aliases in the child site
- Create a registered user in the child portal
- Log out
- Try to log in the child portal as the registered user created before

*Actual result*
 - Page is reloaded but the user is not logged in. 

*Expected result*
- The user should be logged in the child site


[Mohit] Simplified Steps:
Build 3.0.0.134
User is still not able to login in a child site of localhost application

3.	Index and store all the SearchDocuments of 1.
The step 2 is done by comparing some fields of the stored search documents with the fields of the new search document.

Imagine this situation:

The enhancement proposal is to add a flag to the NotificationType table, to specify if the notification should be displayed in the task list:
- The logic in Social_cmx_GetTasks SPROC will be simplified
- The default value should be false (each notification type needs to be updated in Content/Social to set this to true; taking into consideration upgrades vs. new installations)
- This column, IsTask, should be created via the Platform as a bit column and have all values set to 0 (false) then add a constraint for NOT NULL.

When the {{ReturnUrl}} parameter _itself_ contains query string parameters which are percent-encoded, those parameters are not correctly handled by the *Login.aspx* page.

For example, if I navigate to the following URL in my browser:

{{http://localhost/dnn732/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fdnn732%2fTestPage1.aspx%3fa%3dhttp%253A%252F%252Fgoogle.com}}

However it does not work, and instead I just get redirected to the default home page without the parameter in the query string.

To get the correct behavior, I have to use a workaround by double-encoding the parameter. So if I navigate to the following URL:

http://localhost/dnn732/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fdnn732%2fTestPage1.aspx%3fa%3dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fgoogle.com

Then after logging in I get redirected to the correct page with the parameter in the query string.

From Customer: 

Here is a screencast of the bug happening and being debugged in DNN's code:
http://screencast.com/t/PcaQrv6W
We've investigated this method (UpdateModuleSettingInternal) further and we have found what is the problem.
ModuleController.cs line 685
The method uses a datareader in order to determine if a setting already exists in the ModuleSettings table and add or update the setting as it is appropriate. This is a VERY bad idea, DataReaders keep their connection with the tables they use open while they themselves are not closed, at least partially. You can imagine that trying to update a table that is being kept open milliseconds before can eventually result in a deadlock. That is what is happening in this case.
When the datareader reads the 17Kb Lorem ipsum that was already uploaded to ModuleSettings, the table gets locked, so when the code gets to ""dataProvider.UpdateModuleSetting(moduleId, settingName, settingValue, UserController.Instance.GetCurrentUserInfo().UserID);"" and calls the SP that updates ModuleSettings, the SP hangs when trying to update the table.
Since the data we where modifying in the table was already there, we commented in UpdateModuleSettingInternal all that had to do with the datareader and AddModuleSetting. This made the code work flawlessly every time instead of hanging every time.
Possible solution for this: My approach would be something like removing the datareader, and instead checking for an existing row at stored procedure level. The ""If exists"" statement has a better performance and has the perk of not locking the table after it has run. Then, in case the row exists, insert or update as needed.
Of course, this is just a suggestion, but bear in mind that since the column SettingValue is nvarchar(max), large values are not beyond the scope of what could happen (and we have proved it happened in one of our clients).
We just wanted to let you know of the problem and a possible fix. Let me know if I can be of any futher help with this issue.

*Expected Result*
The profile picture is displayed properly

*INFO*
In 7.2.1 the user profile picture thumbnails were created directly with the File.Copy (System.IO) method. The File Manager API was not used. The result was that the image was stored in the User folder but no reference of this image was stored in the database.
In 7.2.2  the user profile picture thumbnails generation was improved to use the File Manager API.

Even if the image is stored in the folder, when the thumbnail is requested by the Client the File Manager API is not able to find it (the thumbnail is not registered in the database) so the system regenerates it calling the FileManager.AddFile method. 

The AddFile throws the Null Reference Exception in this special scenario.
In line 353 the folder provider tells that the file exists because is physically stored in the Folder.
{code}
bool fileExists = folderProvider.FileExists(folder, fileName);
{code}
In line 362 the Get File will return a NULL FileInfo because this is not registered in the database
{code}
var oldFile = fileExists ? GetFile(folder, fileName, true) : null;
{code}
In line 433 the system calls the IsFileOutOfPublishPeriod method passing in input a NULL oldFile
{code}
if (fileExists && FileLockingController.Instance.IsFileOutOfPublishPeriod(oldFile, folder.PortalID, createdByUserID))
{code} 
Finally the IsFileOutOfPublishPeriod method throws the Null Reference Exception.
Note: this methods does not throw the exception if called by an Admin or SuperUser. In this case the image is properly added into the system and the issue is no longer reproducible for this user profile picture.

Possible solution could be change the IF in line 433 to

The user think all files were extracted; but in reality, not all files were extracted. The unknown file types were ignored.
Proposed enhancement:
If the zip package contains files with unsupported extensions, we should provide feedback to the user that some files could not be extracted because those extensions are not supported.&nbsp;
After the extract is completed, a message can be displayed to the user:

h2. Showing Common when an item has been bookmarked
When a user has bookmarked a module tile in the control bar, from that point on, their default view should be the 'common' list, showing their bookmarked tiles.

This works when a tile is first bookmarked, but refreshing the page goes back to the 'All' view.  It is important to show only the common view to make it more usable.

h2. Search all modules

When the 'Add Module' drop down is clicked, the focus is put into the 'search' box, which is good.  However, if the search shows the 'common' view (as per the previous requirement) - the search will not find matching items in the 'All' box.

This needs to change so that if no search results are found for the current context (assuming it is not 'all'), the search will be run again, but in the 'All' category.  As this is a two-step process, the message should show 'No Modules Available in 'Common', Searching 'All'... with the same searching icon.   The second search is done in the context of 'All'.  

h2.  Use Mouse Scroll Wheel to horizontally scroll.

To make the scroll work even more intuitively, hook up an event to the mouse scroll wheel, so that when the pointer is over the add modules pane, the scroll wheel scrolls the items left and right.    Scrolling 'down' (wheel spinning from front to back) should scroll the bar towards the right (ie, show more).  Scrolling 'up' (wheel spinning from back to front) should scroll the bar towards the left.

+Requirements+
* When any module has been bookmarked for by a user, the default view for that user will change from 'All' to 'Common' next time the page loads and the 'Add Module' drop down is used.
* Any search in a category other than 'All' will repeat in the category of 'All' if no results were found.  When the search is repeated, the 'No Modules Available' message will be replaced with 'No Modules available in '{category}', searching in 'All''.
* Using the mouse scroll wheel while hovering over the add modules area should scroll the bar.

h3. Conversation
The current permissions grid design works well for the default installed list of users.  However, it does not scale well when large lists of groups are created.  
Current Grid design:
!current-grid-design.png!

The existing permissions grid will be replaced with a new design.  The new design lists only those permissions which are already set, and provides a way of adding new groups to have a permission configured.
 
1.	Permissions grid – default view.  Shows Group/ Role drop downs and newly added role highlighted when added (yellow fades back).  Add username uses the drop-down list of users filtered as text is entered (existing implementation - see sending messages from user profile).
!7-04-2014 9-06-52 AM.png!
 
2.  When the permissions grid is expanded beyond the ability to view horizontally, then it should scroll horizontally, leaving the role name and ‘actions’ column visible.
!grid-horizontal-scroll (1).png!
 
h3. Confirmation
-	When the permissions grid loads, it shows only those permissions which are currently used for the object that the grid refers to
-	The ‘Add Role’ function is always visible to users who have the authority to change the permissions
-	When the ‘Add Role’ button is clicked, a row will be added to the top of the grid, and will briefly change color to highlight that it has just been added, as feedback to the user.
-	The ‘select role group’ and ‘select role’ drop downs will work with each other to filter down the entries, as is done elsewhere in DNN
-	If the number of permissions columns exceeds the available width of the grid, a horizontal scroll bar will appear, which will scroll the centre of the permissions grid but leave the first and last columns fixed.
-	All other permissions grid functions will work as normal.
-	Clicking on the ‘delete’ icon in the ‘Actions’ column will remove all permissions related to the role that was deleted.
-	Clicking on the ‘delete’ icon should show a confirmation dialog, including the name of the role clicked.   The text must come from the correct resources file, and the English confirmation should be:
o	Title : Confirm Role Permission Delete
o	Question : Are you sure you wish to delete the permissions for [role name]?
o	Buttons : Yes/No or OK/Cancel.

NOTE : Horizontal scrolling is lower priority than all the other changes.

The file picker/uploader has the ability to drop a file directly into the target location.  It also shows an ‘upload’ button.  This, and other upload buttons are used throughout DNN.  They generally launch an operating-system file picker to choose a file and upload it to the site.  These will all be replaced with a new file upload control which allows for multiple drag and drop.  There will be some exceptions to this, which are noted below in the ‘File Uploader – Replacments’ section.
In areas where the upload is to a fixed folder location (by the implementing code), the Folder location will not be visible.

h2. Conversation
All file selections in DNN use a File Drop down, which is unwieldy and slow when the number of files in a folder increases.  This change will replace the use of drop-downs for file selection with a file picker in the same pattern as the folder and page pickers already developed.

h2. Conversation

Throughout DNN a combination file picker/uploader is used.  This allows users to either choose an existing file or to upload a new file to the location specified.  The new design will retain the presentation of the old design, but will change the style of the drop-downs to ensure that they do not grow large when the underlying list is large – whether that is folders or files.   This will ensure faster performance of the UI and easier user experience to find a file or folder.
The drag-and-drop uploader makes selection of a file simpler.  This feature will remain as is currently in use.

h2. Confirmation
•	The existing file picker / uploader control will have the folder and file drop-downs replaced
•	The folder picker will be re-used as it is elsewhere in the DNN Platform (such as in the file Upload control)
•	The file drop-down will be created to use the same style and functionality as the folder-picker, only it will list out the filenames instead of folder names
•	If the folder picker changes the selection, the list of files in the file picker will change to match.
•	The search for a filename will work by matching all the filenames in the selected folder.
•	The file upload will work in the same way, and the file will be uploaded into the currently selected folder.
•	The new file drop-down (the file picker) will be used as a stand-alone control, as well as being part of the file picker/uploader.

The data file is structured for performance when stored on the disk and does not need to be loaded into memory. The new algorithm offsets the performance penalty by being so much faster. The other advantage is that the startup time is a lot faster because the data does not need to be loaded into memory. The data file on the disk does however need to be uncompressed. For those needing faster performance and who can accept more memory usage there is an attribute called memoryMode (set to true) in the config file that will load it into memory.

See : Capture2-en.PNG

In French and German language appears and culture code switch from lower case to stored culture code (not the portal alias for language) :
See : Capture2-fr.PNG

After investigations with my associate Vincent, we have found  the cause :
As we are Mobile, It search an alias for Mobile (and don't find one)
See : Capture5.PNG

We can't create the same alias for Mobile Browser in DB as there is a Unique Index on the colum HttpAlias.
perhaps the index should be on the paired HttpAlias / browserType to allow to have a same on for both case when needed.

The proposed fix is to get  the foundalias without filter by browser type, It should still work when  BrowserType Mobile will be settable.( Not sure about the BrowserType objectives beside mobile redirection).

See : Capture6.PNG

Once fixed we get :

1, As Host, create a page, put in page menu, delete the default HTML module, and Add Social Group module
2, Grant View permission for registered user to the page
3, Copy Permission to Children
4, Use Auto Config for Social Group module
5, Create a group
6, Create a user through Admin - User Account
7, As Host, post some items and comments to Journal module under Social Group
8, Run Site Crawler in Host - Schedule
9, In another browser, log on as the registered user
10, Join the social group
11, In search box at top right corner, type in a word which is included in a post or comment in Journal module under Social Group
12, Leave the group as the registered user
13, Clear cache and recycle app pool
14, As the registered user, type in the same word as last time and run the search

Actual results:
Even after the user leaves the social group, the user is still able to search the contents for the social group

Expected results:
Once the user leaves a social group, it should not be able to search any content from that group

robert.cui,2014-01-14T19:40:44.000-0800,brucerchapman,"This item relates to the ability for a third-party module to raise a 404 and have the standard DNN 404 handler catch and handle it.

The DNN 404 handler does the following things:
1) logs the 404 to a special 404 exception type
2) shows the portal-specific 404 page
3) sends back a 'true' 404 status code, instead of the asp.net standard of generating a 302 redirect to an error page.

When module developers wish to intentionally throw a 404 error in their code (such as when a wrong-for-the-module URL is requested, such as a non-existent blog post), they cannot currently get the DNN 404 handler to deal with this.  This is because the general-exception handling catches any raised 404 exception, and turns it over to the general exception handling behaviour, which is to show an error page.

The requirements for this change are to:
1) Allow a module developer to raise a 404 exception in their module code
2) Have an unhandled 404 exception bubble up until it is in the main DNN Exception handling code (for the page lifecycle)
3) Have 404 exceptions passed-through as a special case to the URL Rewriting 404 Handling code, so that it will return a 404 status code and show the portal-specific 404 page.

Test Case
-------------
For the test case, a module will have to be built which has a simple way of generating a 404.  This is suggested to be a simple module with a view control that returns a 404 if you reuqest a set URL (ie /status/404) for the page the module exists on.  This module should be built as part of making the change and provided to the QA team.   The module should also have a way of generating a 'generic' 500 exception, to show that the normal exception handling is not affected (ie /status/500)

Step 1 : Verify that 404 handling is working as expected (example.com/junkurl)
Step 2 : Install the exception-testing module
Step 3 : Request a 404 Exception

-Expected Result-
Shows the same 404 page as Step 1

Step 4: Request a 500 Exception
-Expected Result-
Shows the DNN error page, and not the 404 page.",Improvement,High,brucerchapman,2014-02-10T18:06:35.000-0800,6,Closed,Done,Allow 404 Exception Bubbling from Modules,2014-02-13T13:12:15.000-0800,DNN-4664,8.0,dnn,7.2.2 Sprint 2

post 12/23/2013 9:46 AM by Marco Kijlstra)

I ran into a high CPU problem on our production server last week. (DNN version 6.2.5). The problem did not manifest itself on our single core test-environment, nor in our development environments. There also seemed to be no relation between any particular request and the probability of the problem occurring.

I made dumps using DebugDiag and the (32 bit version of) taskmanager. Analyses of the dumps with WinDbg  showed all of the runaway threads busy with an Insert call on a generic dictionary in the UserController.GetCachedUser method.

This method indeed gets a dictionary from the cache and sets a value on it. The dictionary is a common generic dictionary, not thread-safe. However the object is shared among threads through the cache, and thus a thread-safe dictionary should be used.

I have fixed this by changing line 242 in method UserController.GetUserLookupDictionary so that the CBO.GetCachedObject overload with the saveInDictionary parameter is used, having set the saveInDictionary  parameter to true.

I have attached the fixed version of UserController.cs. See lines 242-251

This bug probably also affects all 7+ versions and earlier 6.. versions. because the offending methods have not been changed.

So far, the high CPU problem has not returned in the past 24 hours. Before the fix, the problem would manifest itself one or more times per hour. The fix does not seam to have had any adverse effects on performance or otherwise.",Bug,High,makijlstra,2014-05-28T08:36:23.000-0700,6,Closed,Done,Runaway threads causing high CPU usage of DNN w3wp process on all cores,2014-07-15T09:03:51.000-0700,DNN-4484,2.0,dnn,7.3.1 Sprint 1

This means that when errors occur in the module, the users sees an error message that doesn't have anything to do with the real error.  In the same way, when they look in the Event Viewer, they need to know to ignore the most recent error, and look at the first error that occurred in the group of errors.

3
As soon as one of the View or Edit permission set to Deny the second one is changed to Deny as well; both check boxes are active and could be changed to any other settings in accordance to the next rules.

It literally means that a collection was changed (items added, removed or collection cleared) while another thread was doing an enumeration on the object.  The collection is no longer in the state expected during the enumeration process and so the exception is thrown.

However, why this is….  It could either be a bug in that a collection is being accessed by multiple threads without a thread lock (all generic collections in c# are not thread safe and require locking to be implemented by the developer) – or it could be something else within the caching provider.

The first place to look is in the UserOnlineController.SetUserList function – when and where this is called and if it could lead to a thread unsafe operation.

The simple fix would be to check whether {{TargetFile}} is {{null}}.  But this overlooks the bigger issue, which is that when the XML Merge script is in a different file, the changes in it are applied directly to the target file (e.g. web.config).  This is in contrast to when the XML Merge script is included inline (and to components of other types) which apply changes to temporary files and then commit once the changes are verified as successful.

The fix in DNN-3373 was to add two properties to the {{DnnPageDropDownList}} control, to determine whether to include hidden pages and pages of ""all types"" (i.e. URL pages).  However, in addition to optionally allowing selection of those pages, even if those two new properties are {{false}}, the children of those pages still need to be available to be selected.

,2013-09-04T16:58:25.000-0700,ludik.duran,"Description - Customer has provided us with a bug that they found. Customers email following:

The logic in the if...else code block that checks if a Redirect_AfterRegistration page was set in Portal Settings, and sets the RedirectURL accordingly, is backwards. If a redirect page was set, the value of the

""Redirect_AfterRegistration"" portal setting returned is a positive integer value corresponding to the TabID of the page the new user should be redirected to after registration. If no page was set, or if the Administrator manually selects

""<None Specified>"" for this setting, then the value returned is -1. Therefore, the logic in this code block (as currently shipped in version 7.1.1) is backwards and results in new users being redirected incorrectly after registering on

the site.

When the logic checks if the setting is > 0, it should redirect to the URL of the TabID set for the after registration page. Otherwise, if a positive value was not returned (ie. no redirect after registration page was set), it should

then begin the code block to check for the returnurl parameter value (if sent in querystring), or remain on the same page if no returnurl parameter value was specified. The current code's logic blocks need flip flopped to work as

designed.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

1. In Site Settings > User Account Settings > Registration Settings, set the User Registration type to ""Public"", Registration Form Type to ""Standard"", and set Redirect After Registration dropdown to any page (except the Home or Getting

Started pages) that is viewable by Registered Users. Be sure to Save settings.
2. If it is not already set, temporarily set View permissions on the Getting Started page to allow viewing by Registered Users.
3. Logout.
4. Navigate to registration page with a manually set ""returnurl"" parameter value in the querystring that would return you to the Getting Started page, as such: /?ctl=register&returnurl=%2fGettingStarted.aspx
5. Fill out the registration form as a new user and click ""Register"".
6. Note that instead of being redirected to the page you selected in the Redirect After Registration settings dropdown (which is where you should have been redirected to), you are redirected to the Getting Started page, which was passed

as the returnurl parameter value in querystring.

(NOTE: If you do not select a page for Redirect After Registration in the Site Settings, then you are always redirected to 404 or Home page (relative url path = ""/"") regardless of value for returnurl parameter. The reversed logic sees

that the value is not > 0, so in the else, it tries to redirect you to page with ID of the returned setting value (which in the case where none was set, the returned value is -1). There is no page found with ID = -1 when NavigateURL

tries to resolve it.)

Isn't that nice and pretty? After doing some soul searching, I was able to track down the cause of the problem, and come up with a solution. The problem comes from the fact that I previously used the Ifinity FriendlyUrl Provider for DNN. Even though I am no longer using it, the DLL for the provider still exists within my installation's BIN folder. Something in DNN 7.1.2 changed, and now there is a conflict with this DLL. You'll need to delete the iFinity.FriendlyUrlProvider.dll from your website's BIN folder. You will also need to find any references to the DLL/NameSpaces in your web.config file.

Replace this (this first one probably isn't used in IIS 7+ websites, but if your web.config has it, change it)

<add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""iFinity.DNN.Modules.FriendlyUrl.UrlRewriteModule, iFinity.FriendlyUrlProvider"" />

with this

<add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""DotNetNuke.HttpModules.UrlRewriteModule, DotNetNuke.HttpModules"" />

and replace this

<add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""iFinity.DNN.Modules.FriendlyUrl.UrlRewriteModule, iFinity.FriendlyUrlProvider"" preCondition=""managedHandler"" />

with this

<add name=""UrlRewrite"" type=""DotNetNuke.HttpModules.UrlRewriteModule, DotNetNuke.HttpModules"" preCondition=""managedHandler"" />

Then finally your friendlyUrl section of the web.config should most likely look like this

,2013-09-23T11:31:08.000-0700,Nathan.Rover,"I've found an issue regarding how shared assemblies are handled when a third party module is removed that references an assembly shared by the platform.

In the DotNetNuke.Data.SqlDataProvider file from line 1452 to 1456 you will see a bit of SQL that is used to register the Newtonsoft.Json.dll into the Assemblies table.

-- Add rows to {databaseOwner}[{objectQualifier}Assemblies]
SET IDENTITY_INSERT {databaseOwner}[{objectQualifier}Assemblies] ON
INSERT INTO {databaseOwner}[{objectQualifier}Assemblies] ([AssemblyID], [PackageID], [AssemblyName], [Version]) VALUES (1, NULL, N'Newtonsoft.Json.dll', N'4.5.6')
SET IDENTITY_INSERT {databaseOwner}[{objectQualifier}Assemblies] OFF
-- Operation applied to 1 rows out of 18

If you look at the code, you will see that the second value which is passed into the PackageID  column is set to NULL

If you look at the code for the UnRegisterAssembly procedure you will see that if the packageID is null then the return code is 1 which will allow the file to be deleted.

ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[UnRegisterAssembly]
	@PackageID     int,
	@AssemblyName   nvarchar(250)
AS
	DECLARE @ReturnCode bit
	SET @ReturnCode = 1 -- 1 = Can Delete Assembly, 0 = Cannot Delete Assembly

	-- First remove the Assembly Reference for this Package
	DELETE FROM dbo.Assemblies
		WHERE PackageID = @PackageID
			AND AssemblyName = @AssemblyName

	-- Next check if any other Package is using this assembly
	SET @PackageID = (SELECT TOP 1 PackageID 
							FROM dbo.Assemblies
							WHERE AssemblyName = @AssemblyName)

	IF @PackageID IS NOT NULL
		-- Set ReturnCode = 0, so assembly is not deleted
		SET @ReturnCode = 0

	SELECT @ReturnCode

so, when a third party module includes the Newtonsoft.Json.dll file in it's list of assemblies, then when that module is uninstalled the DeleteFile method ( http://www.dnnsoftware.com/community-blog/cid/134857/The-New-Extension-Installer-Manifest-ndash-Part-4-The-Assembly-Component ) will delete the dll which will break the new service framework and anything built on top of it. 

To fix this, a package ID will need to be associated with the Newtonsoft.Json.dll file in the Assembly table.

I would also suggest that ALL core dlls be registered in this table.

What were to happen if a module included a dll for PetaPoco.dll or SharpZipLib.dll or System.Web.Http.dll etc. and that module were to be uninstalled. given what I see here, if those assemblies are not ""protected"" by being registered in the Assemblies table then the removal of them by the uninstall of a module could result in a major failure of the site.",Bug,High,Nathan.Rover,2013-12-03T20:10:43.000-0800,6,Closed,Done,Issue with Newtonsoft.Json.dll,2014-01-06T18:40:10.000-0800,DNN-3718,1.0,dnn,7.2.1 Sprint 3

The problem occurs in the stored procedure GetPortalsByUser, which uses a view called vw_Portals. 
This contains the field LogoFile that is made out of the following query:CASE WHEN LEFT (LOWER(PL.LogoFile) , 7) = &#39;fileid=&#39; THEN (SELECT Folder + FileName FROM dbo.fv_vw_Files WHERE fileid = CAST((RIGHT (LOWER(PL.LogoFile) , Len(PL.LogoFile) - 7)) AS int)) ELSE PL.LogoFile END
This is where the cast error comes from, because it is casting the last character of logo.png (&#39;g&#39;) to an INT.

Solution: Add a new logo in sitesettings. It will change the default &#39;logo.png&#39; to something like fileId=1.

please think about updating the SharpZipLib version that is included in DNN. In the current version SharpZipLib 0.81.0.1407 is included which seems to be very old (https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpZipLib/wiki/Release-History). Since we use SharpZipLib in our custom modules to build zip files and we need the Zip64 feature of SharpZipLib it would be very helpful if DNN includes an up-to-date SharpZipLib.

I will now try to replace the existing SharpZipLib.dll with the new version and hopefully this won't break any DNN core functionality that relies on the old SharpZipLib version.

,2013-08-15T16:27:13.000-0700,ashish.prasad,"Currently the Site Crawler in the Platform does not crawl Journal items. Journal integration with Search is a bit tricky as Journal has a different permission system as compared with module / tab permissions. There are two ways this integration can be done:

*Treat Journal as Module and implement ModuleSearchBase*

1)	The advantage of this approach is that all you need to implement is ModuleSearchBase and the content will start to get indexed by Site Crawler.
2)	However, there is a downside that Journal has a different permission system then typical module / tab permission. During indexing, one would need to translate Journal’s permission into module type permission so Search can do security trimming.

*New Crawler - Create a new SearchType for Journal*

1)	This approach allows checking of Journal permission at querying time.
2)	This SearchType should implement BaseResultController, especially the HasViewPermission method. GetDocUrl method in this method is marked as abstract, but isn't called if Url is already stored in the SearchDocument.
3)	There is no need to create a separate scheduled tasked. All we need to do is modify Site Crawler to call into Journal to obtain SearchDocuments. Site Crawler currently crawls through tab and module metadata and collects SearchDocuments from modules that implement ISearchable or ModuleSearchBase. 
4)	When user performs a query and hits are found in Journal, system will call HasViewPermission method every hit in Lucene. This will require a DB hit to check permission, which is a down-side. 
5)	Make sure the SearchType is not marked as Private.
In reality 90% of Journal entries are Public (except for ones in a Social Group), a mixed approach can be done, where permission is stored in the Index for all the public items so there isn’t a hit.

With this in mind, creating a new custom module should be no more difficult than it is to add an existing module to a page.

Owner Name: DotNetNuke requires a unique top level namespace to ensure uniqueness. The owner name could be an organization name, brand name, developer’s name, etc... The system will save the value provided as a Host Setting so that it can be used as a default for any modules created in the future.
Module Name: A short name to identify the purpose of the module
Description: Optional. A description of the module
Language: C# or VB. The default is C#. Changing the selection reloads the list of Templates.
Template: A list of templates loaded dynamically based on the Language selected. It will only display templates of type “Module”. There are 3 different dynamic module models which can be utilized based on preference – Inline Script, User Control, and Razor. The default will be “Module – User Control”. When a user selects a template, it will load and display an associated “readme.txt” file ( if one exists ). The readme.txt file can contain a description of the template files, but it can also include code samples which could be cut and pasted into the module control to add additional functionality.
Control Name: Modules can contain multiple controls. This option allows the user to specify the name of the file created. The default will be “View”

When the developer presses the Create Module button it will register the module in the database, create a module category for the Owner and associate it to the module, and update the ModuleDefID of the module instance with the ModuleDefID of the newly registered module.

This will add Portal Level SMTP settings into the mix. I've added a radio button list to the SiteSettings control which will ask the user if they want the default host smtp, or the new portal based settings. The modifications next go into the Library\Entities\Host\Host.vb file, and check if the current portal has these settings specified, if they do it will return the portal settings and not the host settings. This should account for every custom module that uses SMTP without any breaking changes. No modifications were necessary in the Mail class. 

The only bugs I can think might show up, is if the current portal has portal smtp enabled and you go into host to check the host smtp it will probably return the portals settings, you'll need to goto the configured HostPortalId to view the host smtp settings in this case.

In previous versions, the Template Manager in the Telerik editor only showed files that ended with the .htmtemplate extension. That is no longer the case. As the attached screen shot shows, all files are listed in the Template Manager selection window.



Not sure if this happens on clean installs, so I am listing the way our demo environment is able to reproduce this. I can post a backup of the environment should you not be able to reproduce this issue again.


I used EE for this, but this feature should be the same across all editions.


I marked this as ""Minor"" but this looks horrible in our sales demos to prospective customers.


Clear Steps to Reproduce:

    Clean install of 06.02.00
    Upgrade incrementally to 06.02.02
    Populate the Portals directory with several files of various types (can be done prior to upgrade too)
    Ensure that at least one of those files is a HTML template file
    Login with any user that can edit content (I used a Host user)
    Edit content in a HTML module

When not in Edit mode, clicking ""Stay in Edit Mode"" should be available, and turn Edit Mode on (in addition to checking the option).

In addition, the deactivated states of Stay in edit mode and View in layout mode are barely noticeable, where the checkbox darkens slightly. This is made worse by the lack of a hover state to indicate they are active. To resolve this:

,2012-12-28T09:42:00.000-0800,hismightiness,"Brief Description of Issue:
In DNN 7, we have broken the ability for Admins to be able to allow non-admins to manage users on their site.  This is a very common use case where organizations would typically allow lower level person(s) or certain managers the ability to manage users.  This is an especially common use case among social websites where community managers will need to field user account issues, but do not need or should not have administrator privileges..
We have broken this capability in DNN 7.  No longer can you give non-admins access to the User Accounts page and allow them to manage users.  You cannot even allow this when putting the module on a non-admin page.  You can still get to manage the user&apos;s security roles, but you cannot create new users or edit existing users.
Since I personally know of numerous sites that do this in 6.x and am even talking to customers regularly that want to do this, I have given this a higher priority and severity.  I hope that we can get this fixed sooner than later.  :)


Clear Steps to Reproduce:

    Clean install of any edition of DNN 7.0.0
    Create a new user 
    Create a security role for the new user
    Allow the security role to have View permission to the User Accounts page
    Give the security role permission to edit the module or full control
    ... OR ...
    Create a new page 
    Add the User Accounts module to the new page as an ""Existing Module""
    Give the security role edit or full control of the module
    Login as the new user

Actual Result:

    The edit options all appear to be available, but the user is greeted with a message telling them that they are not authorized.
