### This repository is part of my Master's Thesis and contains all of the files and scripts that were used for the analysis purpose of the study.

- Student: **Mirlind Murati**
- Supervisor: **Ezequiel Scott**
- Thesis Topic: **Compliance Checking of the Scrum Framework**
- Institute of Computer Science - Software Engineering
- University of Tartu & TalTech, Estonia (2021)


Thesis can be accessed as a PDF: [Compliance Checking of Scrum](https://github.com/mirlindm/MasterThesis-Mirlind-2021)

## Thesis Objective ðŸŽ¯
- The main aim of this thesis is to check and verify how compliant is/was the development phase of certain open-source against the Scrum Agile framework. 
- In simpler words, it aims to check whether the development teams were actually doing Scrum, and if yes, to what extent they were doing so.

## How ðŸ¤”? 
- With a set of defined Scrum Rules (check thesis to see these rules) applied over the development data traces of certain open-source projects (more information over the projects can be found in the thesis file), I have conducted a study analysis to check the compliance of these development teams towards the Scrum framework as defined by the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide).


## This GitHub repository contains the analysis part of this thesis 
- All of the datasets included in my study can be found within the directory: **Datasets**.
- All of the Python scripts and notebooks used to carry the different parts of the analysis, such as data cleaning and pre-processing, implementation of the pre-defined Scrum rules through the Python scripts, can be found in the directory: **Notebooks**.

## Clarification
- I have used the **Datasets Analysis** notebook as a general file to separate the data of the different projects in separate datasets. 
- Thereafter, for each dataset, I have created a respective notebook file, in order to carry out the analysis of each project in isolation.
- The results are reported altogether in the thesis (PDF file).

## Usage
- Download or clone this repository to your local machine: 
```
git clone https://github.com/mirlindm/MasterThesis-Mirlind-2021
``` 
- Upload the Python notebooks in your preferred computational notebook tool or app, such as Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, etc.
- For each notebook, upload the corresponding dataset (csv file) of the respective open-source project, such as Nexus, XD, etc.
- Run all of the code cells within the notebooks
- Check the outputs and verify the results
